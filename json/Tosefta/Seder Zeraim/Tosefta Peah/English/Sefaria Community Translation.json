            "These are the things that have no set amount: the peah, the bikkurim, the r'iyah, charity, and learning Torah. Peah has a minimum amount but does not have a maximum amount. [If] one makes his entire field peah, it is not peah.", 
            "These are the things that are [constantly] subtracting from a person['s ultimate reward] in this world while the principal remains for him in the world to come: idolatry, sexual perversion, and murder; and slander is equal to all of them.", 
            "A good deed has immediate and future benefit, as it is stated (Isaiah 3:10), \"Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.\" A transgression has immediate damage but no future damage [for the transgressor], as it is stated (Isaiah 3:11), \"Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for the work of his hands shall be done to him.\" How, then, am I to understand \"[The wicked] shall eat of the fruit of their own way\" (Proverbs 1:31)? Rather, when a transgression damages, it has immediate damage, and when it does not damage, it has no immediate damage.", 
            "A good thought [Hashem] combines to action; a bad thought Hashem does not combine to action, as it is stated, \"If I had regarded iniquity in my heart [the Lord would not hear].\" How, then, am I to understand \"Behold I am bringing evil, fruit of your thoughts?\" Rather, a good thought that does good Hashem combines to action, and that which does not do good Hashem does not combine to action."
