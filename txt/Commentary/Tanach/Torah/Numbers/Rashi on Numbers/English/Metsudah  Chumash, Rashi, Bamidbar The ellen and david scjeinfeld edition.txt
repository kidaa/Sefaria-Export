Rashi on Numbers

Chapter 1



Verse 1

AND HE SPOKE... IN THE SINAI DESERT... ON THE FIRST (Day) OF THE (Second) MONTH ETC. Because they (the Jews) are precious before him (Hashem) He counts them all the time; when they went out of Egypt He counted them, and when they fell because of (the sin of) the golden calf He counted them to know the number of those who remained, when He came to cause His presence to rest upon them He counted them. On the first day of Nissan the Mishkon was set up, and on the first day of Iyar He counted them.
