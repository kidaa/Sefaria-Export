Mishneh Torah, Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah

Chapter 1

The Reading of the Megillah in its (proper) time is a positive commandment of the Scribes. And it is known that it is an enactment of the Prophets. All are obligated in its reading: men, women, converts, and freed slaves. And we educate minors in its reading. Even Priests engaged in service [of the Temple] cease their service and come to hear the reading of the Megillah, and similarly do we cease Torah study to hear the reading of the Megillah. How much more so, then, are all other commandments of the Torah superseded by the reading of the Megillah. There is nothing that the reading of the Megillah does not supersede, except the burial of a deceased person who has no one to bury him; one who encounters his [corpse] buries it first, then reads [Megillah].
Both the reader and the person who hears the reader have fulfilled their obligation. And this is so if he heard it from someone who was obligated to read it. Therefore, if the reader was a minor or a fool, the person who heard it has not fulfilled his obligation.
The commandment is to read it entirely, and the commandments is to read it at night and in the day. One may read the nightly reading the entire night, and one may read the day reading the entire day. The one who blesses before the nightly reading makes three blessings, and these are they: "Blessed are you God our God, king of the world, who sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us upon the reading of the Megillah." "Blessed are you God our God, king of the world, who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days and this time." "Blessed are you God our God, king of the world, who renews us and preserves us and lets us reach this time." And during the day, one does not repeat and make the "Renew us" blessing. And places that have the custom to bless after [the reading], bless, "Blessed are you God our God, king of the world, the God who fights our fights, and judges our judgement, and avenges our vengeances, who retaliates for our suffering, who pays back on all the enemies of our souls. Blessed are you God who retaliates for Israel from all their suffering, the God who saves."
Which is the time of its reading? The Sages instituted many times, as it says, "in their times." And these are the times of its reading: Any province that was surrounded by a wall from the times of Joshua bin Nun, whether in the land [of Israel] or outside the land [of Israel]. even if it has no wall now, reads on the 15th of Adar. And this province is called a "k'rach" - "large city". And any province that was not surrounded by a wall from the times of Joshua, even if it has a wall now, reads on the 14th. And this province is called an "ir" - "small city." 
The province of Shushan, though it was not surrounded by a wall at the time of Joshua son of Nun reads it on the 15th, because the miracle occurred there, as it says, "And on the 15th they rested" (Esther 9:18). And why was the issue made dependent on the time of Joshua? In order to honor the Land of Israel, which was in ruins at that time. So they read it like the people of Shushan do, and consider themselves to be surrounded by a wall, even though they are now in ruins, since they were walled cities in the time of Joshua they read it on the 15th, and it would be a reminder of the Land of Israel in this miracle.


Chapter 2


If he found a community that already read half, he must not say, "I will read the latter half with the community and go back and read the first half," since this is reading it in its reverse order. Instead he must read it from its beginning to the end in the proper order. If he read and paused briefly and went back to read it, even if he paused long enough to finish all of it, since he read it in the proper order, he has fulfilled his obligation.
One who reads the megillah by heart has not fulfilled one's obligation. One who speaks a foreign language that hears the megillah written in the holy language and holy script, despite that one does not know what they are saying has fulfilled one's obligation. And this is also so if it was written in Greek and one heard it - one fulfilled one's obligation despite that one is not familiar [with Greek], and even if the one who hears [speaks] Hebrew.

He who reads the megillah without intending to has not fulfilled his obligation. How could this happen? If he was writing it, or explicating it, or examining it, if he intended to fulfill his obligation with this reading, he has fulfilled his obligation, and if he did not intend to fulfill his obligation, he did not fulfill it. If he was reading it and he began to doze off, since he did not fall asleep fully, he has fulfilled his obligation.









What is the nature of our obligation for this feast? A person should eat meat and prepare as attractive a feast as his means permit. He should drink wine until he becomes intoxicated and falls asleep in his intoxication. And similarly a a person is obligated to send two portions of meat or two types of cooked food or two types of food to his friend, as it says (Esther 9:22) "and send portions one man to another" two portions to one man. And all that increase to send to others is praiseworthy. And if he has no [money] he should exchange with his friend: this one sends to this his meal and this one sends to this his meal in order to fulfill (Esther 9:22) "and send portions one man to another".
One is obligated to give to poor people on the day of Purim. One should give no less than two poor people one gift each of money or types of cooked dishes or types of food, as it says (Esther 9:22) "gifts to the poor": two gifts to to poor people. And one should not be particular about Purim money, rather give to every person who puts out his hand. And one should not change Purim money for another charity.
It is good for people to increase in their gifts to the poor more than they increase in their meal and the gifts that they send to their companions, for there is no greater or glorious joy than to bring happiness to the hearts of the poor and orphans and widows and strangers, for he who brings happiness to the hearts of these unfortunate people is compared to the Divine Presence, as it says, "To revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones" (Isaiah 57:15).
All the books of the Prophets and all the Writings will be annulled in the days of the Messiah, apart from Megillat Esther. It will continue to be binding like the Five Books of Moses and the entire Oral Law which will never be invalidated. Even though all memory of our suffering will be erased…still the days of Purim will not be annulled.

Chapter 3






And the Hallel recited on Channukah is not the only Rabbinically decreed recitation, rather it is a Rabbinical obligation every day that the Hallel is read in its entirety. And there are eighteen days each year that it is obligatory to say the complete Hallel, and they are listed as following: the eight days of [Sukkot] (lit. "the holiday"), the eight days of Channukah, the first day of Passover and Shavuot (Atzeret). But Hallel is not said on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur because they are days of repentance (lit. returning), awe, and fear, but not days of unrestrained joy. However, Hallel was not [Rabbinically] decreed on Purim, because the reading of the Megillah is [said in place of] Hallel.

Chapter 4

How many lights do you kindle on Chanukah?  It is a commandment that one light be kindled in each and every house whether it be a household with many people or a house with a single person.  To exalt the mitzvah, one may kindle light according to the number of people in the household, a light for each and every person, whether they are men or women.  One who wishes to further glorify this and performs the mitzvah in the most choice manner kindles a light for each person on the first night and adds on following nights one light.










The mitzvah of the Hanukkah candle is an extremely dear one. And one must be careful with it, to publicize the miracle and to increase the praise of God and the thanks to him for the miracles he has done for us. Even if one does not have anything to eat except from charity, he borrows, or he sells his clothes and gets oil and candles and lights.
Therefore, if one has only a limited amount of money, and the mitzvot available to him are either kiddush of Shabbat or lighting the Hanukkah candles, preference should be given to buying oil for lighting the Hanukkah candles over buying wine for kiddush, since both are mitzvot instituted by the Sages. One gives preference to Hanukkah candles, as they have an additional component of recalling the miracle.
14 Someone had a light for his house or light for chanuka, or a light for his house or for the sanctification of the day; the light for the house come first for the sake of peace in the home. For surely God is erased in order to make peace between a husband and wife. Great is the peace for all of the Torah was given in order to make peace in the world as it says; her ways are the ways of pleasantness and all her paths are that of peace.
