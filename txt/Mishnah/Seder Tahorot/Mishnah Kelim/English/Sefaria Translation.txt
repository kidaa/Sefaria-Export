Mishnah Kelim

Chapter 1



Chapter 2

Utensils of wood, leather, bone, or glass that are flat are not susceptible to ritual impurity. If they form a receptacle they are susceptible. If they are broken, they become pure. If one then made utensils from them, they are subject to ritual impurity from then on. Earthenware vessels and vessels of alum-crystal are alike in matters of ritual impurity: they contract impurity and convey impurity through their air-space, and they contract impurity from what touches their bottoms but not from what touches their outer sides; and when they are broken they become pure.
Small earthenware vessels, and bottoms and sides that can stand without support, [can become ritually impure] if their size is enough to hold oil to anoint a small child, up to a <em>log</em>.  From a <em>log</em> to a <em>seah</em>, [they can contract ritual impurity if they can still hold] a <em>revi'it</em> [quarter of a <em>log</em>. From a <em>seah</em> to two <em>se'in</em>, [if they can still hold] half a <em>log</em>. From two <em>se'in</em> to three, and up to five <em>se'in</em>, [if they can still hold] a <em>log</em>: the words of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: I would not prescribe any measure for the vessels; small earthenware vessels, and bottoms and sides that can stand without support, the size [at which they can contract ritual impurity] from a size large enough [to hold oil] to anoint a small child up to a small cooking pot. From small cooking pots to Lydda jars, [they can contract ritual impurity if they can still hold] a <em>revi'it</em>; from Lydda jars to Bethlehem jars, a half-<em>log</em>; from Bethlem jars to large storage jars, [if they can still hold] one <em>log</em>. Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai says: The measure for large storage jars is two <em>login</em>; for the bottoms of Galilean flasks and small vessels, any amount; but their sides are not [susceptible to impurity].
Among earthenware utensils, these are not susceptible to ritual impurity: a tray without a rim, a breached fire-pan, a tube for parched corn, gutter spouts, even if they are bent or even if they retain [water], a clay lid that is used as a bread basket, a pitcher made to be used for grapes, a jar for swimmers, a jar let into the sides of a ladling-jar, a bed, a stool, a bench, a table, a ship, an earthenware lampstand; these are not susceptible ritual impurity. This is the rule: Any earthenware vessel that does not have an inside cannot contract impurity from its outside. 
If a lantern [of earthenware] has a reservoir for oil it is susceptible to impurity; if it has not, it is not susceptible. A potter's mold with which he begins [to shape the clay] is not susceptible to impurity; but that with which he finishes it is susceptible. A funnel belonging to householders is not susceptible to impurity, but one that belongs to peddlers is susceptible, since it serves also as a measure: the words of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira. But Rabbi Akiva says: because he lays it on its side to let the buyer smell it. 
The covers of wine-jars and oil-jars and the cover of papyrus jars are not susceptible to impurity, but if they were adapted for another use they are susceptible. If the cover of a stew pot has a hole in it or if it has a pointed top, it is not susceptible to uncleanness; if there is no hole in it or it has not a pointed top, it is susceptible, because she drains the vegetables into it. Rabbi Eliezer ben Zadok says: Because she turns out the contents on to it. 
If a defective jar was found in the furnace before its manufacture was complete it is not susceptible to ritual impurity; but after its completion, it is susceptible. A sprinkler Rabbi Eliezer ben Zadok declares insusceptible to impurity, but Rabbi Yose declares it susceptible because it only lets the liquid out in drops.
Among earthenware vessels these are susceptible to ritual impurity: a tray with a rim, an unbroken firepan, and a tray that is made up of several dishes. If one of them was rendered impure by a <em>sheretz</em> [one of several creeping creatures], they are not all rendered impure; but if the tray had a rim that was higher [than the component dishes], and one dish was rendered impure, all become impure. So too, with an earthenware spice-pot, or a double inkstand. But if one part in a wooden spice-pot is rendered unclean by a liquid, the other is not rendered unclean. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: they divide the thickness of the partition and the half that serves the impure part is considered impure, and the half that serves the pure part is considered pure. But if it had a higher rim, and one part was rendered impure, the other part becomes impure also.
A torch is susceptible to ritual impurity, and the reservoir of a lamp is susceptible to impurity from its air-space. The comb-shaped filter of a water-cooler Rabbi Eliezer declares insusceptible to impurity; but the Sages declare it susceptible.
