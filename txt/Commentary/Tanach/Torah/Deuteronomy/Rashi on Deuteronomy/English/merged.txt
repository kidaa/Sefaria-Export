If there will be among you a needy person: The most needy person has priority. - [Sifrei]
from one of your brothers: Your brother on your father’s side has priority over your brother on your mother’s side. — [Sifrei]
[in one of] your cities: The poor of your city have priority over the poor of another city. - [Sifrei]
you shall not harden [your heart]: Some people suffer [as they deliberate] whether they should give [to the needy] or they should not give; therefore it says: “you shall not harden [your heart].” Some people stretch out their hand [to give], but then close it; therefore it says: “nor close your hand.” - [Sifrei]
[nor close your hand] from your needy brother: If you do not give him, you will ultimately become a“brother of the needy” [i.e., becoming needy yourself]. — [Sifrei]
