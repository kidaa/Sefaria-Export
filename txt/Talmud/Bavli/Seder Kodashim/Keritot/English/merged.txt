Rav Ami said, 
"That person that wants to know whether [his life] will extend through the year or not, should bring a candle during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and suspend it in a room where the wind is not blowing. If its light (its flame) continues, he will know that he will take out the year.
And a person that wants to conduct a business deal and wants to  know if the deal will be a successful one or not, should feed a chicken. If it becomes fat and beautiful, he will know that it will be successful.
That person that wants to go on a journey and wants to know if he will return to his home, should go out and stand in a partially darkened room. If he sees

Daf 6a

a shadow in the shadow of his shadow, he will know that he will return to his home."
And this is not a [correct] matter, lest his spirit become weak [as a result] and his [fortune guided by his] constellation will become bad.
Abbaye said,
"Now that you have said that a sign is a [correct] matter, a man should accustom himself to eating squash, beans, leeks, beets and dates on Rosh Hashanah."
