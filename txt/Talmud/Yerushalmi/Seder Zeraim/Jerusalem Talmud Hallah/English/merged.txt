Jerusalem Talmud Hallah

Daf 1a

MISHNAH: Five things are subject to the challah (obligation); wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye.  These are subject in challah; and they combine with each other and they are forbidden under the laws of the new grain (chadash) to be eaten before the Passover or to be harvested before the omer, and if they took root before the omer, the omer (causes them to be) permitted and if (they did) not (take root) -they are forbidden until the next omer comes.
GEMARAH: Five things are subject to the challah obligation etc.: It is written "...then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall set apart a portion for a gift unto the LORD." (Numbers 15:19)...(it) could be (that) all things (e.g. the five grains) are subject to the challah (obligation).  (The Torah therefore) states: "from the bread" but not all bread, If "from bread" and not "all bread" There isn't anything for me besides wheat and barley alone (that are subject to challah obligation)  From where (do we know the obligation applies to) spelt, oats, and rye? (The Torah therefore) states: "Of the first of your doughs..." (Numbers 15:20) [that] includes (the other three grains as well) But let (this verse) include (bread made of) all (types of grain!)...R. Yosie (said) in the name of R. Simeon: (The Tanna) R. Ishmael taught thus (i.e. that the verse "from the bread" excludes all other types of grain whereas "your doughs"includes spelt, oats, and rye) [this was taught by] R. Yonah (in the name of) R. Ze'era (in the name of) R. Simeon b. Lakish, in the name of R. Ishmael...R. Mana said" I went to Caesarea and I heard R. ...

Daf 1b

Achvah and R. Ze'era and (my) father (conversing) [R. Mana's father was R. Yonah acc. to Mahara Fulda] he was saying to him in the name of R. Ishmael we say 'bread' with (regards to) Passover and we say 'bread' regarding challah (and so) just as we say 'bread' regarding Passover is a thing that comes in the form of (lit. by way of) matzah  and chametz (leavened bread)...we also say 'challah' is a thing that comes in the form of matzah  and chametz.  And they checked [by way of expieremental cooking] and they realized that you don't get anything coming in the form of (both) matzah  or chametz except for the five species (of grain) alone.  All other things don't come in the form of matzah  and chametz except by way of rotting.  We learn in the following Baraita (that) R. Yohanan b. Nuri said: karmit [fennel flower? or rye-grass? acc. to Mahara Fulda] is subject to the challah (obligation) R. Yohanan b. Nuri said this (karmit) can come in the form of matzah  or chametz (and therefore is subject to the challah obligation) but the Rabbis (of the Mishnah) say  it cannot be in the form of matzah or chametz.  And let them check karmit! (to see if it can become chametz or not...they did indeed check and) the results of their experiment were (a source of) dispute among (the Rabbis!)  R. Yohanan b. Nuri said they checked out karmit and found out that it can become matzah or chametz (depending on preparation) but the Rabbis said (they too) checked (into the matter) and found out that it (e.g. karmit) can not become matzah or chametz.  R. Hila (said) in the name of R. Simeon b. Lakish: we haven't learned (lit. repeated) [anything] except "If one makes dough from a mixture of wheat and rice" (Mishnah Challah 3:7) [which suggests] that (rice) is being pulled (into being defined as bread) only (when mixed) with wheat [but not the other five spices of grain]  What is (the law regarding those) liable (under the laws of chadash [see Leviticus 23:14]) for parched corn {קלי} (before the omer?)  R. Ze'era said it is written "And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears..." (ibid.)  That which is liable for its bread on account of chadash is liable for its parched corn on account of chadash.  R. Jeremiah inquired before R. Ze'eria: (assuming one) mixed four kav'in (of rice flour?) buy themselves and they became leavened and [after that he mixed] 4 kav'in by themselves and (then) mixed (both mixtures together) He (R. Ze'eria) said to him behold! in the moment the (five) species are obligated to become matzah and chametz (they are) called 'bread!' [even if this mixture cannot become leavened, it is subject to the challah obligation.  The teaching of R. Yonah is in accordance with (that of) R. Jeremiah
