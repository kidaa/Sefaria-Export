Verse 1

Since Aharon performed, and troubled himself, in regard to the wonders, just as much as Moshe, He (G-d) does him this honor at the first mitzvah, by including him with Moshe in this message
---[but] outside the city. or was that not so, but [it was] rather within the city? The Torah, therefore, states [concerning Moshe's prayer]: "When I leave the city, etc." Now, if [regarding] prayer, which is [relatively] less significant, he would not pray within the city for it was full of idols, then, [regarding] a message [from G-d], which is so much more significant, how much more so [that he would leave the city.]

Verse 2

He (G-d) showed him the moon at its renewal and said to him, "When the moon renews itself, let that be for you the beginning of a new month." However, Scripture does not depart from its plain meaning: He (G-d) was telling him about the month of Nissan; [viz.] this (Nissan) shall be the start of the order of the counting of the months, so that Iyar will be called the second [month] and Sivan, the third.
Moshe had difficulty regarding the renewal of the moon how much of it must be visible so that it be fit to be consecrated. He (G-d) then showed him with His "finger" the moon in the sky, and said to him, "When you see it like this, sanctify it." But how could He show it to him--- did He not speak with him only by day, as it is said: "And on the day that G-d spoke," [or:] "on the day that He commanded him," [or:] "from the day that G-d commanded and beyond?" But [the answer is] it was near sunset [when] this section was told to him (Moshe) and He pointed it out to him at nightfall. 

Verse 3

But did Aharon speak? Has it not already been stated "You (Moshe) speak?" But [the answer is] they bestowed honor on each other and said to one another: "Teach me [what to say]." The message would then emanate from both, as if both were speaking
[I.e.,] "Speak today, on the first of the month that they should take it (the lamb) on the tenth of the month.

Verse 4

[I.e.,] If they are too few to be sufficient for one lamb, so that they are unable to eat it [all] and will thus come to [the transgression of] {Hebrew Ref} , then "Let him and his neighbor take, etc.," That is the implication here according to its plain meaning. However, there is also an exposition [of the Sages]: [This verse intends] to teach that [even] after they have been counted in it they may [still] be excluded [from the group] and withdraw their association from it and be counted as [partners] of another lamb. However, if they do decide to withdraw their association and be counted [as partners] of another lamb, then this should be done " {Hebrew Ref} "--- [i.e.,] they should be excluded while the lamb still exists, [that is to say,] while it is still alive and not once it has been slaughtered
[ {Hebrew Ref} means: according to] the number. Similarly: {Hebrew Ref} [means the number of the evaluation].
Each according to his fitness to eat, to exclude the sick and the old who cannot eat a kezayis (a piece the size of an olive)
[As Onkelos translates it:] {Hebrew Ref} ---you will count yourselves.
