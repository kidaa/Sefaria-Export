Verse 1

"To the conductor, listen to this all nations" - this psalm is very important, because it explains the light of the afterlife (lit. World to come) and the undying soul of wisdom.

Verse 2

"Listen" - to the message he gives, that addresses all in whose nostrils G-d (lit. hashem, the name) blew the breath of life. Therefore, "listen all who dwell on Earth".

Verse 3

"Also" - calling the sons of Adam who aren't wealthy, or who are and are well known. That is the reason for also having "sons of man", to include the rich and the poor.

Verse 4

"My mouth" - to teach all the wisdom hidden from them, which those wise of heart explain by riddles.
And "thoughts and insights" - that my heart thought.
