Two baskets, one of un-dedicated produce and one of dedicated produce, and before them are two vessels, one of un-dedicated produce and one of dedicated produce, and the latter fell into the former - they are permitted, as I can say that the un-dedicated fell into the un-dedicated, and that the dedicated fell into the dedicated. And even though there is more un-dedicated produce than dedicated. What case are we speaking of? One of dedicated produce in our times, which is a Rabbinic commandment; but dedicated produce that derives from a Torah commandment, until the un-dedicated food outnumbers the dedicated food [a non-priest cannot eat it].
