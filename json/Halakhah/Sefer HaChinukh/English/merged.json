            "The mitzvah of procreation: In parshat Bereishit there is one positive commandment and that is the mitzvah of procreation as it says (Genesis 1:28): 'And God blessed them and told them to procreate'.", 
            "The root of this mitzvah (i.e the reason behind this commandment) is that the world should be settled (B.T Gittin 41b) because God wants the world to be settled as it says (Isaiah 45:18)'I did not create it for naught, but [rather] formed it for habitation'. This is a big mitzvah with which all the mitzvos are observed because [the Torah] was given to humans [who need to procreate] and not to angels [who don't].", 
            "The laws of this mitzva including when a man is obligated to engage himself in it, and how many sons he needs to have, and what other mitzvot he is exempt from due to his involvement in procreation, as well as many other laws are explained in the sixth chapter of tractate Yevamot (61b and 62b) and in Berachot (16a). [It is also codified as practical law in] Shulcan Aruch [section] Even Haezer chapter 1, and in [section] Orach Chaim chapter 70:3.", 
            "This [mitzvah] applies in all places and at all times (in history-not every moment of one's life) (Kidushin  36b), and a person is obligated to engage in this mitzvah when it is fitting for him and this is the age which the sages (Avot 5:21) says to marry a woman [which is age 18]. This mitzvah is not obligatory for woman. One who refrains from this mitzvah is responsible for not engaging in a positive commandment and his punishment is very great (Kiddushin 29b) because he shows that he does not want to fulfill God's will to settle the world."

            "The Commandment to Circumcise - [Parashat] Lekh Lekha [wherein there is] one commandment and that is the commandment to circumcise as it says (Genesis 17:10) \"This is My covenant which you shall keep, between you and I, and with your descendants after you, circumcise all males.\" And [the commandment] is repeated in the Order of Tazria, as it says, (Vayikra 12:3) \"And on the eighth day circumcise the flesh of his foreskin.\" There are many commandments which are repeated in many places in the Torah, and all of them necessary as the sages interpreted (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 132a and Talmud Shabbat 135a). And the practice of this commandment [involves] cutting the foreskin that covers the head of the member and then tearing the sorting skin which is below it so that the glans of the member will be exposed. As is known to those that understand the completion of the form of man comes with the removal of this foreskin which is extraneous. "

            "Not to eat the sciatic nerve—the portion of \"Vayishlach\" has one negative commandment, the prohibition of [eating] the sciatic nerve, as it says: \"Therefore the Children of Israel shall not eat the sciatic nerve.\" (Genesis 32:33) And this [phrase] \"the Children of Israel shall not eat\" is not to be taken as part of the story, to mean that because this event occurred to [our] forefather, [we, his] descendents refrain from eating that nerve. Rather, it is a prohibition of God that they (the Jews) shall not eat it.", 
            "Of the roots of this commandment: To serve as an indication to Israel that though they will suffer many oppressions in the exile by the nations and the descendents of Esau (i.e. the Christians), [the Jews] should trust that they will not perish, but rather that their descendents and name will stand firm forever, and that their redeemer will come and redeem them from their oppressor. And in continually remembering this idea through the commandment that serves as a reminder, they will stand firm in their faith and righteousness forever. And this indication [stems from the fact that] that angel who fought with Jacob our forefather, who according to tradition (Genesis Rabbah 78) was the guardian angel of Esau, wished to eliminate Jacob from the world, he and his descendents, but could not get the better of him, (Genesis 32:26) and anguished him in injuring his thigh. Likewise, Esau's descendents anguish Jacob's descendents, but in the end, [the latter] will be saved from them. As we find (Genesis 32:32) with respect to [our] forefather that the sun shone to heal him and he was saved from anguish, so will the sun of the Messiah shine, and he will heal us from our anguish and redeem us speedily in our days, amen!",

            "This commandment applies in all places and at all times, to both men and women. And one who transgresses and eats a [prohibited] sinew, even if it is less than an olive's-worth, or eats an olive's-worth of a large sciatic nerve, receives lashes. (See Chullin 96a)",

            "The commandment of sanctifying the new month—to sanctify months and intercalate [months into] years in the Court [whose members are the] greatest in wisdom and ordained in the Land of Israel, and to establish the year's holidays according to that sanctification, as it says, \"This month shall be to you the first of months.\" (Exodus 12:2) This means, when you see the renewal of the moon, establish for yourselves the new month, or even if you do not see it, since it is appropriate for [the moon] to appear according to the accepted calculation. Likewise, this commandment includes the commandment of intercalation, since the basis of the commandment to sanctify the month is for Israel to observe God's holidays at their appointed times. And the commandment of intercalation  has the same basis. However, beyond this verse are more Torah passages concerning the commandment of intercalation, as it is written, \"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time\" (Exodus 13:10); and likewise, \"Observe the month of Abib.\" (Deuteronomy 16:11)", 
            "The procedure of the commandment: Two Jews fit to testify come before the court and testify before them that they saw the renewed moon. They establish the new month on the basis of their [testimony] and say, \"Today has been sanctified.\" The reason why this commandment applies only with ordained judges is because of the interpretation [of the verse], \"This month shall be for you,\" i.e. great [in Torah] and ordained, like you (Rosh Hashanah 22a), since [this verse] was said to Moses and Aaron. This matter was further expounded, as it is juxtaposed to \"speak to the entire congregation of the children of Israel,\" meaning that they who sanctify the month must have the assent of all Israel, meaning the wisest men of Israel, such as the Great Court (the Sanhedrin). And so any great wise man in Israel who was ordained in the Land of Israel. And since ordination is no longer practiced, as is known, [the wise man] has permission to perform this commandment even outside the Land of Israel, so long as there is no one of his statue in the Land of Israel. And so we find that Hanania ben Ahai, R. Joshua, and R. Akiba ben Yosef did so in this regard. (Berakhot 23a) But without these conditions, no one of Israel is permitted to establish the months or intercalate. And if you ask: If so, how do we conduct ourselves today, when we lack ordained wise men? Know that thus we have received [our calendar], since R. Hillel the Prince, son of R. Judah the Prince, who was the greatest of his generation and ordained in the Land of Israel—he was the wise man who fixed for us the calculation of intercalation, sanctified future months, and intercalated  future [months into] years until the coming of Elijah (i.e. until the Messianic Era), and it is upon this that we rely today. That which we have said all follows the opinion of Maimonides. However, Nahmanides (in the Book of Commandments, Positive Commandments, number 153), considers the sanctification of the month as one commandment and intercalation a separate commandment. His proofs (for dividing these into two separate commandments are) in his Book of Commandments. And so the Ba'al Halakhot (considers these separate commandments). And the verse that teaches about the commandment of intercalation, that is, that we calculate the seasons in order to make the holidays in their (proper,) established times, is \"\"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time,\" (Exodus 13:10) and so, \"Observe the month of Abib,\" (Deuteronomy 16:11) as we have written....", 
            "Of the roots of this commandment: so that Israel shall make God's holidays in their (proper) times, as God commanded that we make Passover in the time of produce, the spring, as is written, \"Observe the month of Abib, and you shall offer the Passover sacrifice.\" (Deuteronomy 16:1) And the holiday of Sukkot is [to fall] at the time of the [fruit] harvest, as is written,  \"And the Festival of the Harvest at the turn of the year.\" (Exodus 34:22) And were it not for intercalation, the holidays would come not at these times, since Israel calculates their months and festivals according to the lunar year, which has 354 days, 8 hours, and 876 halakim , which is less than the solar year by 10 days, 21 hours, and 204 halakim, (a mnemonic: 10, 21, 204). Due to the ripening of the produce and fruit from the power of the sun, it turns out that but for intercalation, by which we align the lunar and solar years, Passover would not come in spring, nor Sukkot at the time of the [fruit] harvest. And this matter is to be fixed by the greatest [scholars] of the generation, since it is a matter requiring great wisdom, and since it is also said that from this [calculation one comes to know] the agricultural happenings of the year, it is appropriate to give [this task] only to great and pious men.", 
            "The laws of this commandment, [including]—interrogating [those who offer] testimony concerning the new month; instilling fear in the witnesses on occasion; the law concerning circumstances under which the Sabbath may be desecrated for this testimony; for what [considerations] we do or do not intercalate; and which month they would intercalate, i.e. Adar, as [our Sages] expounded: \"You shall observe this commandment in its proper time\" (Exodus 13:10): this teaches that we only intercalate at the time near the holiday. And furthermore did they expound on this verse: From where do we know that we only intercalate the month during daytime? [We learn this from the] verse, [which] says, \"from year to year\" (yamim yemima, a play on yom, day) (Sanhedrin 10b); and furthermore did they expound: \"For the months of the year\" (Exodus 12:2): it is months you calculate towards the year, not days. (Megillah 5a) Furthermore did they say on this matter: \"A month's time (hodesh yamim)\": it is days (yamim) you calculate towards the month, not hours (Megillah 5a); and the rest of its details—are explained in Tractate Rosh Hashanah (25b), and in the first chapter of Sanhedrin (11b), and similarly in Berakhot. (Maimonides, Laws of Sanctification of the New Month 1)", 
            "[This commandment] applies in all places and at all times when we have ordained wise men, according to the aforementioned conditions. One who transgresses and does not [sanctify the new month or intercalate the month], if he be a wise man for whom it is appropriate, has neglected a positive commandment, and his punishment is very great since he causes the ruining of the holidays. And now, when in our sins we no longer have intercalation by ordained [scholars], our calculation relies on the accepted calculation from R. Hillel, as we have said. "

            "Among the roots of this commandment: To remember the miracles of Egypt, as we have written elsewhere. And this is also a trunk from this root, for it is not honorable for the sons of kings and the highests advisors of the land to drag the bones and break them as dogs do, and it is an ugly thing, left only to the impoverished and starving. And therefore, as we began to become the chosen of all nations, a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Ibid. 19:6), and in each and every year at that time, it is proper for us to do acts that show in us the great virtue which we acheived at that hour. And in the act and reenactment that we do, this great virtue is placed in our souls for eternity. My son, do not pounce upon my words and say why would the Name (i.e. God) command us to do all of these commandments to commemorate that miracle, would we not remember it with one commemoration and thusly, our offspring shall never forget this? You must know, that wisdom would not seize upon this, and your youthful thoughts leads you to this. And now, my son, \"If thou has understanding\" (Job 34, 16), \"incline thine ear and hear\" (Proverbs 22, 17), and I will teach you to benefit from Torah and Mitzvot. You must know, that Man is as acted upon according to his actions, and his heart and all his thoughts always follow after the actions that he does, whether good or bad, and even he who in his heart is a complete sinner and all the desires of his heart are for only evil, if his spirit shall be enlightened and he will put his efforts and actions to persist in Torah and Mitzvot, even if not for the sake of heaven, he shall immediately incline towards Good, and from that which is not for its own sake comes that which is for its own sake [as opposed to personal gain], for the hearts are drawn after the actions. And even if a man is perfectly righteous and his heart is straight and innocent, desiring of Torah and Mitzvot, if he shall constantly deal with improper things; you could compare it to someone who was forced by the king to to work a wicked craft, if he constantly works in that wicked craft, eventually from his righteousness he shall have become completely evil, for it is known and true that every man is acted upon according to his actions, as we havve said. And the Sages of blessed memory said about this: (Makkot 23b) \"God wanted to grant merits to Israel, therefore he gave them many laws and commandments\", to occupy all of our thoughts and all our deeds, to benefit us at our end [i.e. in the world to come]. Because from the good actions we are acted upon to be good and we merit eternal life. And the Sages hinted at this (Menahot 43b), with their statement that everyone who has a Mezuzah on his door, Tzitzis on his garment and Tefillin on his head, he is promised that he shall not sin, for these are constant Mitzvot, and he is constantly acted upon by them."

", 
            "[One of the philosophical reasons] (lit. roots) of this mitzvah, is that we should be free from our preoccupations [in order to focus on] honoring the day [of Shabbat], in order to instill within ourselves faithfulness to the [concept of the universe's creation] (lit. renewal of the universe), which is [a concept that affects many fundamental principles in Judaism] (lit. a rope that drags along all the foundations of our religion). And it should be mentioned once a week, every week, that the universe was created in six distinct days, that nothing was created on the seventh day, and that different [types of creations] were brought into being each day. [All of this confirms the Torah's philosophical idea of G-d's] Simple Will (perhaps the idea that all physical existence emanates from G-d's will), which differs from the philosophers' view (who disgust us with their ideas regarding this matter) that the Blessed One['s existence] is all that [really exists] (meaning nothing exists other than G-d and that creations with distinct parts and existences contradict G-d's infinite nature). And through our [refraining from acts prohibited on Shabbat] (lit. rest) on the Seventh day we are [promoting awareness] of the universe's creation, because, when everyone simultaneously [refrains from acts prohibited on Shabbat] (lit. rest) once a week, curious people will ask what is the point of [refraining from acts prohibited on Shabbat] (lit. rest)?  And the answer will be \"because [in] six days G-d created etc.\" (Exodus 31:17). And through that [answer], everyone will [be committed] (lit. strengthened) to the true [philosophical idea of the universe's creation] (lit. true faithfulness). And in addition to awareness of the universe's creation, [Shabbat] also causes awareness of the miracle of [the Exodus from] Egypt, that we were enslaved and unable to rest whenever we desired, and the Powerful One (G-d) saved us from their hands and commanded us to [refrain from acts prohibited on Shabbat] (lit. rest) on the Seventh day (Shabbat). Therefore, the second philosophical reason (lit. root) is mentioned in Deuteronomy (lit. the repetition of the Torah), as it says in the [context of] the commandment of Shabbat \"And you should remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt... therefore Hashem, your G-d, commanded you to [observe] (lit. make) the day of Shabbat\" (Deuteronomy 5:15)."

Therefore, He, blessed be He, did command to render ownerless all that the land produces in this year, in addition to resting during it (i.e. during the year), so that a person will remember that the land which produces fruits for him every year does so not by its might and virtue, for there is a master over it and over its master, and when He wishes He commands him (i.e. the master of the land) to render them (i.e. the fruit) ownerless. And there is another benefit in this matter, to acquire the trait of letting go (i.e. of one's possessions), for there is no one more generous than he who gives without hope for recompense. And there is another benefit, the outcome of this is that a person will add to his trust in God, may He be blessed, since anyone who finds it in his heart to give and abandon to the world all of the produce of his lands and his ancestral inheritance for an entire year, and educates through this himself and his family for all of his days, will never have the trait of stinginess overcome him too much nor will he have a deficient amount of trust."

And all who do not ready themselves for this – it is a great evil – because they know God's desire in this regard, but still do actions against God's will. And one section of the Torah was written specifically to inform us of this idea, as it says in Parshat Ekev (Devarim 10:12-13), \"And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God request from you? ... For your benefit. That is to say, He is asking you to perform His commandments only because in His great beneficence, he wants to improve you. And similarly, as it says afterwards, \"Behold, to the Lord your God belongs the heavens and the heavens of the heavens, and all that is in it.\" That is to say, He doesn't require your [completion of His] commandments except out of His love for you, and for your merit."

The Torah therefor was not concerned with permitted him to become defiled under any circumstance, even for the relatives where the Torah is concerned about [the well being of] the ordinary priest who will pour out his soul in the house of mourning because of the emotional closeness he feels to the deceased.  the Hight Priest, by contrast, is so throughly bound to loftier pursuits and is entirely separate from human nature.  He has lost any memory of this fleeting world; he will not weep for the loss of one of his society because he was already apart from them in life.  As far as the laws of impurity that comes from the dead, and the details of the tent of the dead, I have already spoken some according to my usual habit in this Parasha, and I will not repeat it least it become burdensome for the reader.",

Perhaps you will say, \"How can we know if this maid has thought lustfully about another man?\"  The response is that for as long as the thought has not been actualized is does not disqualify her, but anytime she had cohabited she is disqualified. Even though Those of Blessed Memory said, \"when she matures she is prohibited,\" the idea is that once she has matured so much her thoughts are pure evil, and perhaps she lusted after another, and since she is an adult her evil thoughts count as a deed."

The blemish refered to in this context is permanent, as is explained in the Sifra (Emor 3:5), \"'Who has a blemish shall not serve' only includes a permanent blemish, how do we know to include a transient blemish?  The verse says in the same section, 'any man who has a blemish shall not come close.'\"  Examples of  permanent blemishes include  eczema and boils that are raised.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah: Since people ascribe value to activities based on the importance of the performers of those activities. A person who appears important and well mannered will find more favor in all that he does before those who see him. In the opposite case, a person who is of low form and unusual appearance will seem unworthy in the eyes of his beholders if his actions are any less than perfect.  It is therefor appropriate that the person on whom atonement depends be of pleasant appearance in all facets so that people will attach their thoughts to him.  Aside from this, it is possible that in his perfect form there is a hint to certain concepts, for as a person contemplates[the perfect form] he will purify his soul and elevate it.  Therefor it is improper for there to be anything unusual in any form in him, lest the soul of the contemplative be scattered due to the anomaly, for it would then be moved from the purpose.", 
            "The laws of the mitzvah:  What Those of Blessed Memory (TBM) said (Talmud, Bechorot 43a), that there are three kinds of blemishes.  Some blemishes disqualify a priest from performing the service, and if similar blemishes were to be found on an animal, the animal would be ineligible to be offered as a sacrifice.   Some other blemishes disqualify a person from the service but do not disqualify an animal as a sacrifice.  And some other blemishes disqualify neither a man nor an animal, and our only concern is the perception of a blemish.  Any priest that shows any of these blemishes may not serve.  Only external blemishes disqualify a person, but blemishes that are inside of his body, like a missing kidney or spleen, or a punctured intestine, even though they render him terminally ill, his service is still valid.  This is because of the verse, \"a broken leg or hand\" just as those are external, so too must all disqualifying blemishes be external.  The Sages enumerated (Rambam, Laws of Biat Mikdash 7:8) 50 blemishes that disqualify both people and animals, 23 that are unique to animals, for a total of 73 in animals.  There are also 90 blemishes that are unique to people, for a total of 143 blemishes in people.  The categories of the 90 that are unique to people are as follow: eight in the head; two in the neck; four in the ears; five in the  shoulders; four in the eye lids; eleven in the eyes; six in the nose; three in the lips; three in the abdomen; three in the back; six in the hands; four in the genitals; fifteen in the thighs and legs; four in the general form of the body; eight in the skin tone.  Four more significant blemishes apply to people that are not external, and these are: deaf-mute; mental retardation; malnutrition (even temporary); and a person who produces a foul odor (even if the timing is predictable).  In addition to these there are two more that present problems of public perception, and these are: One whose eyelashes have fallen off, even though a meaningful amount remains at the root, and one who removed his teeth.", 
            "These are the categories of the fifty disqualifying blemishes that apply to people and animals: five in the ear; three in the eyelid, and these three are included in the term 'gouged' that is used in the Torah; eight in the eye; three in the nose; six in the mouth; twelve in the genitals; six in the arms and legs; four that can be anywhere on the body, and these are the 'eczema' that is mention in the Torah, a protrusion that has a bony form, and this is the 'boil' of the Torah, one who has even a small Egyptian coloring, which is the 'yalefet' mentioned in the Torah,  and any bone that displays a crack, which is the 'harutz' mentioned in the Torah. Ribs are not considered viewable bones.  There are three more: an old individual who shakes when standing; a sick one who trembles because of weakness (though terminal illness is only a disqualifier of animals, as is birth by Caesarian); a repulsive one.  That totals fifty.  More details are found in the seventh chapter of Tractate Bechorot.", 
            "The mitzvah applied to priests when the Temple stood, and one who transgressed this prohibition and served with a blemish, if the blemish would also disqualify an animal, whether the service was performed inadvertently or deliberately, it is invalid, and he is flogged if he acted deliberately.  They also said in the Sifra (Emor 3:11): A blemished [priest] is not punished with death; he has only transgressed a negative prohibition.  If the blemish was one of the ninety that are unique to people, even though he is flogged, the service is still valid.  If the blemish was one that is only perceived as problematic he is not flogged and his service is valid."

What is also called a gift?  These are the first fruits, as Those of Blessed Memory (TOBM) derive from the tradition (Talmud, Pesachim 36b), \"'And the gist of your hand' (Deuteronomy 12:17), there are the first fruits.\"",

Also, a rebellious wife may eat, and any wife of a priest may eat, even if she is only three years and one day old.  Also, the betrothed bride of a priest would have been eligible to eat, but the Sages decreed that she may not until they are fully married, as is explained in the beginning of the fifth chapter of Ketubot (Talmud Ketubot 57b).  A Hebrew servant does not eat, because the Torah forbids both the perennial worker and the annual worker, as it is written, \"The boarder of a priest and his worker may not eat the sacred\" (Leviticus 22:10).  But a non-Jewish slave does eat, because he is his acquired property.  Also, if the slave acquires other slaves they may eat because of his rights. This is because implicit in the expression, \"when he acquires with an acquisition\" (Leviticus 22:11), that the acquired is acquiring.  If, however, the second-tier slave acquires a third-tier slave, that slave may not eat, because it is 'when the soul acquires,' the Torah allows only one level of acquisition.  Any priestess who had relations with someone who disqualifies from the priesthood is permanently forbidden from eating teruma (Talmud, Yebamot 65a).  The same is true for an androgynous priest, whether the androgynous individual filled the role of the male or the female in the relations.  Even a strecher, that is a person who stretched his foreskin so that he would appear uncircumcised is rabinically proscribed from eating until he receives a second circumcision (Talmud, Yebamot 72a).  Many other details are explained in Tractate Terumot.", 
            "The prohibition against non-priests eating teruma applies to all Jews, male and female, wherever teruma applies on a Torah level.  That is, when the Land of Israel is settled, for then the obligation of teruma exist biblically, as we will, with the help of HaShem, write in Seder Shoftim (Sefer HaChinukh, 507) on the mitzvah of separating the main teruma.  In the present time the prohibition applies rabbinically to produce that is grown in Israel, as we will write there.  One who transgressed and ate teruma and is a non-priest, or even if he or she is a priest who was demoted from the priesthood through one of the mechanisms of demotion that have been taught to us by our Sages OBM, is punished with death from above, and is explained in the ninth chapter of Sanhedrin (Talmud, Sanhedrin 83b) from the verse, \"They shall die through it because they have profaned it\" (Leviticus 22:9), and after that is written, \"Any stranger should not eat the sacred.\""

If HaShem is concerned for them they should endure eternally, because His concern for things is itself their sustenance.  Therefore no species should ever be annihilated from the Earth.  Even though He is concerned for the human species as individuals (as I explained earlier in Parshat Tazria (Sefer HaChinuck, 169))  this is not the case for other species.  For them His concern is for the species as a whole, and we are therefore forbidden from destroying the tree and its offshoots at once, to hint to this.  We can also explain simply that this inspires compassion within us and distances us from cruelty (which is a bad trait).  Therefore, even though we are permitted to use animals to sustain us we are forbidden from slaughtering the parent and offspring on one day, to instill the characteristic of compassion within our souls.", 
            "The laws of the mitzvah: What TOBM said (Talmud, Chullin 82a) that it does not matter of the mother is slaughtered or the offspring; and what they said (Talmud, Chullin 83a) that are four times during the year one who sells an animal to his fellow must inform him if the mother has also been sold for slaughter, because at these four times the purchaser presumably intends to slaughter the animal immediately.  The times are: the eve of the lat day of Sukkot; the eve of the first day of Passover; the eve of Shavuot; and the eve of Rosh HaShanna.  According to rabbi Yosi HaGalili the same applies to the even of Yom Kippur in the Galil.  The obligation to inform rests exclusively on the seller; the buyer need not ask because there is a double doubt.  He does not know if the animal's mother is still living, and even if it is, he does not know if it was sold for slaughter;  They also said (Talmud, Chullin 82a) that if two people buy an animal and its offspring the one who made the first purchase has first rights to slaughter, but if the second broke the rule and did slaughter first, the first one may still not slaughter.  There is also the law of slaughtering a cow and two of her offspring or two offspring and then the cow, and the law of slaughtering her and her 'daughter' and her 'granddaughter'.  It is permitted to slaughter the 'grandmother' and 'granddaughter', because the Torah only forbids \"it and its offspring.\"", 
            "They also said that one who slaughters the 'grandmother' and 'granddaughter' and then the 'daughter'  is flogged only 40 times, even though there are two simultaneous transgressions, it is still one deed.", 
            "They also said (Talmud, Chullin 78b) that the prohibition only applies to mother animals because the Torah says 'its offspring', meaning the one who the offspring is attached to, and that is the mother.  Neverhteless, the Talmud concludes (Talmud, Chullin 79a, according to the proper understanding) that if we conclusively know that this is the father it may not be slaughtered on the same day as the offspring, because the law follows Rabbi Yehuda.  Rabbi Yehuda seems to be uncertain if we concern ourselves with the male parentage, because he says that a mule may not be mated with a horse or a donkey, but only with another mule.  If he truly believed that the male parentage is not followed he would not have said that, instead he would have said the mule may be mated with another mule that shares a maternal type.  Instead he is in doubt, and when he said that we do not concern ourselves with paternity he meant that we cannot be lenient on that basis, but we must be strict when relevant.   In any place that a stringency will result from ignoring paternity, then we ignore it, because it is a case of doubt so we must be strict in every place.  In light of this I say that if we conclusively know the identity of the father we should be concerned for \"it and its offspring.\"  More details are explained in the eighth chapter of Tractate Chullin.",

The editor wrote in the name of Maimonides (Sefer HaMitzvot, Negative Precept #63) that this sin has three components, two of which are on the public on one pertains to the individual.  The first is in any case that one is asked to transgress one of the mitzvot during a time of persecution, and the enforcer intends for this to be a transgression, whether the mitzvah is severe or nor, or if one is asked to transgress idolatry, sexual impropriety, or murder even during a non-persecutory time, he must give his life and be killed rather than transgressing.  If he transgressed and did not die he has profraned the Name in public, and he has violated this commandment, and his sin is very serious.  Nevertheless he is not flogged as he was coerced, and the court can only enforce corporal punishment for deliberate transgression, where there are witnesses and warning.  The Sifra (Kedoshim 4:13) says, on the verse \"If one gives his children to Molech, I will place My face against that person,\" That TOBM said \"That person, and not a case of coercion, nor indavertency, nor confusion.\"  I have already explained that a person who commits an act of idolatry under coerced cicumatances is not punished with kareit, and he is certainly not executed.  He has violated the prohibition against profaning the Name.", 
            "The second type is if a person commits a sin without desire or pursuit of pleasure, but his action is intended to infuriate [God].  This is also profaning the Name and he is flogged, and this is why it says, \"And do not swear falsely in My name and profane the Name of your Lord.\"  In this case the person shows his anger with this thing where there is not physical pleasure in it.  The compoment which addresses the individual is if a person who is well known as a kind person who acts well and commits one misdeed, something that is unfitting for a person of pious character, even if it is a permissible act, he has profaned the Name.  This is what the TOBM said (Talmud, Yoma 86a), \"What is profaning the Name?  If I were to purchase meat from the butcher and not pay immediately.  Another rabbi said, 'If I were to walk four paces without teffilin and without words of Torah.'\"   This prohibition is repeated elsewhere in the verse, \"Do not profane the Name of your Lord, I am HaShem.\"",

This means anything that is prohibited on the strength of it's unique restrictions, as we will soon explain.  Also, sexual impropriety and subcategories, as wella as murder.  Is a person demands that he worship idols or be killed, he should be killed and not worship, even though his heart will remain treu and faithful to HaShem.  He still must die and not commit this evil act and allow the assailant ot believe that he has denied HaShem.  The Sifra says (Sifra Emor 8:6), \"For this reason I took you out of Egypt, so that you will publicly sanctify My name.\"  The same is true for the other two - he must die and not transgress.", 
            "The root of the mitzvah - It is known that Man was only created to serve his Creator.  One who does not sacrifice his body in the service of his master is not a good servant.  Since people do give their lives for their masters we must certainly be willing to do so for the commands of the King of kings, The Holy One Blessed Be He.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah - TOBM said that for these three that we mentioned, a person must always give his life, whether it is a time of persecution or not, whether in public or private, whether the coercer intends to force a religious change or for his own benefit.  For other sins, however, if there is no persecution and it is in private he should transgress and not be killed, even if the intent is religious coercion.  If it is public, that is in the presence of ten Jews, if it is for the coercers benefit, he should transgress.  If it is religious coercion he should be killed.  If there is persecution, even in private and even for his benefit, even for a trivial mitzvah he should be killed. A trivial mitzvah is like what TOBM said, \"even a shoe lace,\" which means a Jew should not wear his shoes in the idolatrous fashion, because he should not look like an idolater.  This is a subcategory of idolatry, anything that is prohibited by a unique prohibition is the field of idolatry, like that TOBM said (Talmud, Pesachim 25a), \"One who is in peril may be healed by anything except for asheira wood.\"  The Yerushalmi said on this (Jerusalem Talmud Shabbat 14:4) that is not only if the doctor says, \"bring me those asheira branches\" which would then seem like deifying it.  It even applies is he says, \"bring some leaves of that tree\" and they can only find the asheira, martyrdom is still required.  Even though when he is healed in this case it is not truly idolatry, for he did not worship it, it is still prohibited because of the prohibition of \"keep nothing of the banned in your hand\" (Deuteronomy 13:18), which is a unique prohibition in the category of idolatry.  But the many restrictions that apply to idolatry that are learned from \"do not place a stumAbling block before the blind\" are not considered a subcategory of idolatry for the purpose of martyrdom, because that prohibition is not unique to idolatry, as it applies to every mitzvah", 
            "After I wrote this I found in some of the novellae of my teaceher (may HaShem protect him) that from the Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud, Avodah Zara 2:2) it seems that if the doctor does not specify [asheira] he should transgress and not die.", 
            "The idea of murder is derived by TOBM from reason, and they said by way of parable, \"What do you see that your blood id redder?  Perhaps the blood of that man is redder.\"  That is, the murdered might be capable of performing more mitzvot than the murderer, and therefore logic dictates that no one can kill anyone else, even if the consequence is death.  They also said, (Jerualem Talmud, Terumot 8:4) that even if there were several thousand Jews and the coercers asked for one of them, or if they should refuse, everyone will be killed, they must all be killed and not give up any Jewish life.  This only applies if they do not specify a person, but if they expressly ask for some individual they may give him over, as in the well known story of Sheva ben Bichri. This is also  the case if they ask for a woman [to rape] as we see in Terumot (Mishnah, Terumot 8:12).", 
            "The idea of sexual impropriety is derived from a connection between the betrothed maiden and murder, and just as murder demands martyrdom, so too a person must doe and not debase a betrothed maiden.  the Torah does not simply tell stories if we cannot learn from them.  They also had support from their tradition which is an iron wall for all that they say.  The early authorities wrote that we only say a person must die rather than sin, but to failing to perform a mitzvah doe not demand martyrdom, as TOBM said about Esther, that she was like still ground.  She was passive and she was raped, and even is the woman assisted in the intercourse midway, she is excused because lust overtook her, and this is the greatest coercion there is.  That we find that the ancient pious ones were killed even for the sake of a mitzvah like TOBM said (Mechilta, Shemot 20:6), \"Why are you being stoned?  Because I circumcised my son.  Why are you being hanged?  Because I shook the lulav.\"  That was an extra measure of piety that they saw was needed in their generation.  Those great sages were qualified to make that judgment.  Otherwise they would not have been permitted to die, becasue not everyone can allow himslef to be killed for other matters than those that were specified by TOBM.  Moreover, they would be held repsonsible for the loss of their lives (Rambam, Yesodei HaTorah 5:4).", 
            "I have also seen in the works of my teacher, that any woman who can be betorhted, such as a widow to the High Priest, or a divorcee to a priest, or a mamzer to a Jew/Jewess, all these cases are not considered improprieties such that one must die for them.  Still, we would not advise anyone to have intercourse with any woman, even if she is single.  He should instead die from the illness that has come from his passion, not cohabit or even speak with her, as we see in Sanhedrin (Talmud, Sanhedrin 75a) and the Book of Madda (Rambam, Yesodei HaTorah 5:9).  More details are explained int he 8th chapter of Sanhedrin and the Peachim, Yoma and elsewhere.", 
            "The miztvah always applies to men and women.  One who transgressed and did not sanctify the Name in a circumstance where he was obligated to do so, has failed to fulfill this mitzvah, and he has also violated the prohition against profaning the Name, as I have already written (Sefer HaChinukh 295).  The sin of profaning the Name is very severe to the point that TOBM said that repentance, Yom Kippur, and afflicitons are not sufficient to atone, only death, as we see in the last chapter of Yoma (Talmud, Yoma 86a)."

            "It is forbidden to do work on the first day of the month of Tishrei as it is written, \"In the Seventh month on the first day ... all hard labor you shall not do. (Lev. 23:24-25).  The seventh month is called 'Tishrei', as it is the seventh from Nissan, which is the New Year for [the count of] months.  The Sages said that this day, the first of Tishrei, is called the New Year for the count of the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee, and we also count from it for plantings and vegetables. (Talmud, Rosh HaShanna 2a).  In the Talmud (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 12a) the Sages explained for what purposes this is considered the New Year.  They also said there (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 16a) that on this day the inhabitants of the world are judged for their deeds.  They explained [HaShem's] awareness of the deeds of each individual and every type as a group, that metaphorically each passes before Him in a orderly procession, that is, one at a time and not combined.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah of this holiday: It was the kindness of HaShem with His creations that he remembers each of them and views their deeds one day each year so that the sin should not mount so greatly, and this allows for the possibility of atonement.  He is abundantly kind and skews toward kindness, and since the sins are [relatively] few, He forgives them. If there are perhaps sins that require expiation, they will be retributed in small pieces.  This is like what the Sages said, \"For His loved ones he retributes in small pieces.\" (Talmud, Avodah Zarah 4a)  If He did not remember them for a longer period they would become so abundant that the whole world would be deserving of destruction, God forbid.", 
            "Thus this honored day is responsible for the sustaining of the world, and it is therefore appropriate to make it a holiday, a part of the count of special days in the year.  On the side that it is the day of judgement for all living things it is proper to stand in more fear on this day than the other holidays of the year.  This is the concept of 'recalling the shofar sound' that is mentioned in connection with this day, because the shofar sound is a broken sound, and it hints to the need for each person to break his evil inclination and regret his evil deeds, as I will explain at length on the mitzvah of Shofar (Sefer HaChinukh : Mitzvah 405), with HaShem's help.  It is for this reason that the Sages did not establish the recitation of Hallel on this holiday, as they said, \"It is not proper for a person to sing songs of praise while he stands in judgement.\"  Rabbi Abahu also said in the final chapter of Rosh HaShanna (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 32b), \"The ministering angels said the HaShem, 'why do the people of Israel not say Hallel on Rosh HaShanna and Yom Kippur? et al.\" as you will find there.", 
            "The laws of resting on the holidays: I wrote some of them (as is my habit) in the Mitzvah of the holiday of Pesach, and it is also proper to write here some of the ideas that are mentioned in Tractate Rosh HaShanna.  They said there that there are four 'New Years' - the first on Nissan is the New Year for kings and holidays, that is, the first of the pilgrimages as explained in the Tamud (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 4a); the first of Elul is the New Year for tithing animals; the first of Tishrei is the new year for the matters mentioned above; the first of Shevat is the New Year for trees according to Beit Shammai, though Beit Hille says that it is the fifteenth of the month.  The Talmud explains for what purposes all these New Years are pertinent.", 
            "They said there (Talmud, Rosh HaShannah 16b), that four behaviors can tear up the [bad] decree for a person: charity, crying out, changing one's name, and changing one's deeds.  The idea of changing a name seems to be that a person should think of himself as if he is someone else (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Repentance 2:4) and improve all of his ways.  Thus anytime he is called he will remember this change and pay attention to it.  They also said that three books are opened on Rosh HaShanna, one for the truly righteous, one for the truly wicked, and one for the people in between.  The idea of opening books seems to be a parable to describe the attentiveness that HaShem has to people.  The Sages always used familiar expressions to allow their ideas to penetrate the ears of the listener.  The righteous are immediately written and sealed for life. (My teacher explained that 'truly righteous' in this instance means 'totally innocent', and 'truly wicked' means 'totally guilty') [The wicked are] therefore sealed immediately for death, since they have no merits to protect them.  [The judgement of] those in between are left suspended until Yom Kippur, at which time a final verdict is sealed.  They also said (in close proximity to the preceding), \"Beit Shammai said, 'there are three groups of people on the Day of Judgement (meaning after death of each person, which is called the Day of Judgement): the truly righteous, the truly wicked, and those in between.  Here they explain that 'truly righteous' and 'truly wicked' reflect the result of the judgement, which resolves any great questions about the issue.  If you merit, my son, you will be sensitive to this and my efforts will put you at ease.", 
            "They also said there that the truly righteous in judgement is sealed immediately for life in the World To Come.  Do not think that the World To Come is identical for all righteous people, for in that life there are infinite gradations, and each righteous person rises to the appropriate level based on his merits (See (Talmud, Shabbat 152a).  More details on these matters are found in the first chapter of Rosh HaShanna (and Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim 602 and Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim 603).",

What is this?  This is eating and drinking.   The Sages similarly explained in the Talmud (Talmud, Yoma 74b): From where do we know the prohibitions against washing, annointing, wearing shoes, and marital relations on Yom Kippur?

Some explain (Talmud, Sukka 11b) that the Israelites made physical huts in the wilderness.

            "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages taught (Talmud, Sukkah 2a) that a Sukka that is higher than 20 cubits is invalid, and also if it is lower than 10 hand-breadths.  It must be at least 7x7 hand-breadths; less than that is invalid.  It needs three walls, and a doorway that it formed by two vertical posts and one on top of them.  The law requires that it have more shade than sun, and if it does not it is invalid.  If one makes a thick house-style roof it is valid. The law is that one may build his Sukka between trees and allow the trees to serve as walls, and one may build a Sukka on a wagon or a boat.  The law is that one may cover over a porch that has door-frames, whether they are onside or outside.  The roof must be made of something that is not susceptible to ritual impurity, such as the leftover stalks and bramble, but not from something that is susceptible to ritual impurity.  The law also considers a case where invalid cover is placed in the middle or on the side.  The law is that three [hand-breadths] of airspace invalidates the covering,  whether it is in the middle or on the side in a small Sukka.  The law is that placing a sheet over the Sukka because of the sun or below [the cover] because falling detritus invalidates it.  If they are hung for beauty it is valid, as anything that beautifies the Sukka is valid.", 
            "The law addresses a  Sukka above another Sukka, The law is that one who sleeps in a canopy in the Sukka may not do so if the roof is even one hand-breadth wide, though he may if it is less.  The law is that if one sleeps under a bed in the Sukka, if the bed is higher than ten hand-breadths he may not do so, but if it is not he may.  Even though [sleeping under] a canopy is forbidden if it less than ten hand-breadths, the bed is different because it is primarily intended to be used as a platform.  If one placed a sheet on two poles he  may sleep underneath it as it has no roof, and it is like making space by supporting it under his arms, which is obviously permitted.  The law is that a stolen Sukka is valid, as land cannot be stolen.  Even if one stole wood and made a Sukka out of them it is valid, as the Sages passed an edict that he is only repsobsible to pay for the wood.  The law is that one who is suffering is exempted from Sukka, for the Torah said 'you shall sit' [which is understood to mean] as you live.  Certainly an ill person is exempted for this reason, and even his nurses are exempted.  Similarly, anyone who is an emissary to perform a mitzvah, and also the bride-groom and his clique, as they are performing a mitzvah.  The law also addresses travelers and watchmen for gardens and orchards, and city watchmen, and rain falling, and the Sukkot of GNB\"Kh and RQB\"Sh, that are valid.  The law is that the wood used to build the Sukka is biblically prohibited for any other use for all seven days, and on the 8th and 9th day in the Diapsora they are forbidden because they are considered set aside.  The decorations of the Sukka are forbidden because of it would degrade the mitzvah to use them, so it is said in the name of Nachmanides (Michamot, Beitzah 4:5).

That is, you should not glean them as a gleaner, as this is the accepted explanation, and it as the Sages explained, (Mishnah, Sheviit 8:6) \"From here they said that that figs [grown during] the Sabbatical year may not be cut with a fig-cutter, but may be cut with a knife.

Land and slaves can be bought with money, a contract, or possession, and the many details of each of these are described in the first chapter of Kiddushin.  Movable properties are acquired though other means such as lifting (see Talmud, Baba Batra 76b), which is the most effective form and works for all movable properties.  Some can be acquired through a lower level acquisition and this is dragging it, and some can be purchased though a still lower level, and this is the handng of the reins.  The Sages proved that (Talmud Baba Metziah 47b)  movable property cannot be acquired though the same means as land from the verse (Lev 25:14) \"Or purchased from you fellow's hand.\"  They explained based on the tradition that this refers to objects must be transferred from one hand to another.  They also brought proofs that land can be purchased in the ways described from other verses. ", 
            "There is no doubt that all of these methods are rabbinic enactments and the verses are used to support their words.  The truth is that their dear wisdom that they would eventually come to realize was hidden and stored in the verses, and even though the primary verses are not intended to teach these laws.  The Sages also said that on a Torah level money is effective even for movable properties, but the the reason they required dragging the item was as a safeguard to avoid the seller saying \"your wheat burnt in the loft.\"  Because of this enactment the Sages said that (Baba Metzia 49b) if the object was in the buyers possession, even if he rented the space to the seller, since the domain is the buyer's and he is always attentive to the state of the object, if something should happen to the object he could recognize the risk rescue it as the seller could, in this case the sale is enacted only through money as the Torah prescribed, and not through dragging it.  Also, i the buyer rents the place that the object is located, dragging et al become ineffective.   The Sages said (Talmud, Baba Batra 85b) that just as a a person's person can acquire for him, so too his belongings can acquire for him in any place that he may leave them.  Once the object is placed inside a vessel neither can retract; it is as if it was lifted or placed inside his house.  In a place where the buyer may not place his vessel, his vessel will not acquire for him, such as the seller's property, or the public domain.  Nevertheless, the Sages said that in the seller's domain if the seller says, \"acquire with this vessel\" or even if he doesn't say it but the buyer acquired another vessel by lifting it and then placed the produce intended for purchase into the vessel, he has immediately acquired the produce.  The pleasure that the seller receives from the sale of the vessel causes him to forgive the place that it sits, and it is as if the vessel is in the buyer's domain.", 
            "Handing over the object works differently, and it is only effective in a public domain or a space that belongs to neither of them (Talmud, Baba Batra 76b).  This method is used for objects that are too large to be lifted or even dragged, such as a large ship that requires an enormous undertaking and a large number of people to move.",

Dragging also acquires in a yard that belongs to both of them, and lifting is effective in all places, as he is lifting the object, and his person can acquire because his body is his domain in all places.", 
            "There is another method of acquisition on a Torah level which is called 'exchange', which was the old method in Israel.  It is essentially a trade of an object for an object, or an object for land, and the Sages said (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Sales 5:5) that once the first party dragged the object the be exchanged, the other object is acquired wherever it may be.  If anything then destroys the object, the loss is absorbed by the purchaser.  Barter only works for vessels and not produce, as produce cannot be used (Talmud, Baba Batra 47a) as implied in the verse, (Rut 4:7) \"And this was the early custom in Israel, a man would remove his shoe.\"  Nevertheless, even though produce cannot be the medium of barter, produce can be acquired through barter, i.e., a person can use a vessel to acquire produce through barter wherever they may be.  The same is not true of coins, which can neither be bartered for or with, because people always think about the face value and it may be devalued by governmental action.  Thus, it is not of constant predictable value and people do not have faith to acquire with it, and it cannot be used for barter.  A coin without face value can be used for barter like any other object.  This is a coin that is no longer in circulation as Reish Lakish said, \"even a purse filled with coins\" which Rabbi Abba understood to refer to coins that were cancelled by the Emperor or the Governor.   ", 
            "When we say that something is not used as barter it does not mean that the sale is annulled and the intended some need not be paid, for he is certainly obliged to pay in full for whatever he has purchased, since he dragged the produce.  "

That is the view of Maimonides (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Shemitta and Yovel 11:1).  Nachmanides (commenatary on the Torah) wrote that this would then be analogous to the Tallmud's discussion in Temura (Talmud, Temura 4b) where Rava said that anything that the Torah proscribed is ineffective and subject to flogging, as he has violated the edicts of the king.  Nachmanides explained it differently, and that is that the lnad cannot be sold to non-Jews, that is, we may not sell to them as a permanent sale.  He explained the verse to mean that we may not sell the land to one who will hold it forever, and that is a non-Jew.  It cannot apply to a Jew because he will return it.  If he stipulated that the non-Jew must return the land it is permitted to sell it to him.",

We said above that in that case both parties have transgressed this law and their action is ineffective, as one may not make conditions that violate the Torah and the Torah said that the land cannot be sold permanently.  If, however, a number of years is mentioned it is not permanent.  The Sages may have derived this from the wording of \"not permanent\" as opposed to \"only until the Jubilee\" which implies that anything other than a permanent sale does not return in the Jubilee.", 
            "Nachmanides explicitly wrote that (commentary on Makkot, 3b) that if one stipulates that the field will  not return in the Jubilee the condition doe not stand and the field does return.  The same is not true for the Sabbatical year, where if one loans on the condition that it will not be cancelled by the Sabbatical the condition does stand, as this relates to money.  He explained that regarding the cancellation of debts the Torah only prohiibitied the activity of the lender, as it says \"Every creditor should cancel all that his fellow owes him\" (Deut. 15:2).  The borrower, however, retains the right to repay if he so desires.  In the context of the Jubilee both the seller and the buyer are included, as we have written, the Torah says \"shall not be sold\" to both of them, as the land belongs to HaShem, and no person has the right to sell it permanently.  Therefore, neither has the authority to forgive the rule, and land is forcibly returned to the ancestral owner, even if they make a thousand conditions that it should not return.  This is a good reason.", 
            "Also in the laws of the mitzvah is the Sages statement (Talmud, Arachin 30a) that if one sells an ancestral field and he also owns other lands, that is, land that he purchased or receives as a gift, and then he sells those fields to redeem his ancestral land, he is not heeded.  The Torah says, \"and he finds enough to redeem\" implying that he did not have it at the time of the sale.  Similarly, if he borrowed and wished to redeem with those funds he is not heeded, as it says \"his hand reached\" and not that he borrowed.",

These are called the ancestral fields, and their laws differ from other lands for the purposes of redeeming.  Ancestral land can be redeemed by the seller or another redeemer after two years without the consent of the buyer.  Other fields, which are called purchased lands, can only be redeemed with the buyers consent, or else they stay with the buyer until the Jubilee.",

We will write later (Sefer Hachinuch 340) that they can also be redeemed without the buyers consent, as it says, \"it shall be redeemed\", but they can be redeemed even in the first year, like houses in a walled city.  Those laws are also explained in the Torah.",

They also said (Talmud, Arachin 29b) that if one sells his field, whether it is ancestral land or purchased land, he may not redeem it for two years, even with the permission of the buyer, as the Torah commands that it stay with the buyer for two years in the verse \"for two harvests it is sold to him.\"  That is directed to the seller; the buyer is included in the verse, \"for a number of years it is acquired\", which must be at least two.  It seems that the idea is that any sale of land must be an act of distress, and a person should not think that he can sell his land and redeem it immediately. He should know that there will be at least two years from the time of the sale that he will miss.  The Sages also said that the buyer must receive two years of harvest from the land, and if one of his years is a year of drought and disease, or a Sabbatical year, it does not count.  [A lean year, however, is counted.]  If he sold it in the Jubilee itself, the sale is invalid, and the money is returned.  If he sold just the trees, they may not be redeemed for two years, and if they are not redeemed they are not returned in the Jubilee, and it says, \"he will return to his portion\" and not to trees.  If he sold it to A and A sold to B and B to C, even if there are 100 buyers, the field returns to the original owner at the Jubilee, as it is written (Lev 27:24) \"to he who is the inheritor of the land.\"  Other details are explained in Tractate Arachin.",

This is true if they performed some deed, as one cannot be flogged unless there is a deed.  This is the view of Maimonides.

Similarly, a  field may not be allowed to revert to meadow, nor vice versa, etc.  They may not be altered in any way.  The concept is well understood, for the Torah commanded (Num. 35:2-7) that the other tribes cede certain cities to the Levites, and these are the 48 cities with the six cities of refuge included.  The Torah also commanded that each city be surrounded by 1000 cubits of meadow (area that provides opportunity for leisure and aesthetic to the city), and 2000 cubits beyond that for fields and vineyards, which also has aesthetic value for the city and provides some of its needs (see Talmud, Sotah 27b).  This law teaches that those states can never be altered, and concerning this it says, \"The fields, meadows and cities shall not be sold.\" We understand the word 'sold' in this context to mean 'altered', for if it were addressing actual sales it would be contradictory as the verse explicitly says that the Levites can always redeem their lands from a buyer, which implies that they may sell them.",

The cities that were therefore equally accessible to all and always on the minds of the people (as no one can tell what tomorrow will bring) needed to be preserved as pristine and glorious places for Israel.

They also taught (Talmud, Arakhin 33b) that if a Kohen or Levite sold his field or house he may always redeem, even if it had been consecrated as it is written, \"An eternal redemption shall be for the Levites.\" (Lev. 25:33)  If an Israelite were to inherit the property from his maternal grandfather who was a Levite he may also redeem according to the laws of the Levites.

Because they were set aside to serve God and minister unto Him and to instruct people at large in His just paths and righteous judgments, as [Deuteronomy 33:10] states: \"They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Torah to Israel.\" Therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world. They do not wage war like the remainder of the Jewish people, nor do they receive an inheritance, nor do they acquire for themselves through their physical power.

            "It is forbidden to lend with interest to a Jew as it is written, \"You shall not give your money with interest, nor should you give your sustenance with increase.\"  These are not two prohibitions -increase is identical with interest, as the Sages said, \"You will not find interest without increase ot increase without interest.  Why did the verse divide them?  (That is, why did it not simply state 'give neither your money nor your food with interest')  To cause the transgression of two prohibitions (that is, to warn multiple times).\" (Talmud, Bava Metzia 61a)  I have explained this idea above (Sefer HaChinukh 336), that the Torah will occasionally repeat offences to show that the behavior is abhorrent to HaShem.  This may be an application of the Sages' concept of \"the Torah speaks in a human voice\" (Talmud, Berakhot 31b); the Torah repeats transgressions that require more vigilance, just as people will repeat themselves and use enhanced language to indicate the severity of an issue so that the listener is vigilant about it.  Though a person should be most careful about the words of HaShem even if they are communicated through the slightest hint, in His great kindness He repeated some commands many times as a parent teaches a child, and we should therefore thank him for all the goodness that he bestows upon us.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah: I have written about it in the prohibition for the guarantor, witnesses and scribe that forbids their involvement is usurious loans (Sefer HaChinukh 68).  ", 
            "The laws of the mitzvah, such as the distinctions that the Sages taught us between interest that is prohibited from the Torah, which they call (Talmud, Bava Metziah 61b) 'definite usury'.  Other forms are rabbinically prohibited, which the Sages called 'the dust of usury'.  There is also another level which is lower than these first two, and this is really permitted as it is far removed from Torah level interest and is not suited for an edict, but the Sages were very strict in this matter for they saw that the Torah is very strict on it.  They passed these restrictions so that a person would not try to work around the law, and not for some other reason.  [Returning to] the three types of interest: Torah level interest describes a case in which a person says to his fellow, \"lend me a manah and I will give you a peruta every day\" or 30 perutas a month, or some other amount, until I pay you back.  Or if he says, \"lend me 100 dinar and i will pay you back 120 after a year,\" or if he lends money and takes a house or courtyard as collateral with the stipulation that he will hold the land and reap the benefit of the produce until the loan is repaid, without subtracting something from the repayment amount, this is definite usury and is prohibited from the Torah.  The general rule is explained by the Sages as \"any case of payment for the time [that the money is kept] is prohibited from the Torah\" (Talmud, Bava Metziah 63b), if the money comes from the borrower to the lender.  In this case the Sages said, \"Definite usury can be extracted by the court\" (Talmud, Bava Metziah 61b). That is, the court may seize assets from the borrower, as is the law for theft and torts.  Others explain that the court is licensed to physically coerce the lender, as is customarily done to someone who refuses to fulfill a positive mitzvah.", 
            "Every other form of interest (aside from those mentioned) are called Rabbinic usury or 'the dust of usury', and they money cannot be retrieved by the court.  The Sages prohibited these as a safeguard lest a person come to transgress the biblical prohibition.  Some forms are like the Sages rule (Talmud, Bava Metziah 70b) that one cannot accept an investment with a guaranteed return of principle from a Jew, nor may deals be priced with produce before it is evaluated (though if the value is established it may be used, for even though the buyer may not possess the produce, someone else does).  This only applies if the buyer does not possess the produce; if he does possess some, even a small amount, he may use it before the price is set.  For instance, he may price out several Se'ah even if he only possesses one, as the law follows Shmuel who took this position in the Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 75a).  When we say that he must have the same type, some hold that it must be exactly the same (Beit Yosef, Yoreh De'ah 175), e.g. he may not set the price in new wheat if he only has old.  Others hold that we do not make a distinction between old and new, anything within the same type is sufficient.  Nevertheless, if he does possess the type, he may price with it even if it is some preparatory steps removed form the relevant product, but if it is more than three steps it is considered something else entirely.  The Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 74a) elaborates on the various steps involved in preparing wheat, as well as manufacturing tools and other things.", 
            "The mitzvah also includes the prohibition against lending with land as a collateral, such that if the money is not returned by such and such a day the land will belong to the lender (Talmud, Bava Metziah 66a), because the acquisition is not binding as it is not performed with certainty.  That is, a person made the assumption that the money would be returned on time and he was not able to fulfill his intention; this is akin to an accident.  In any similar case it is forbidden to reap the benefit because it is interest.  The Talmud provides many examples of uncertain arrangements in matters of interest and other areas.  My teacher (may HaShem guard him) taught us that any punitive condition, that is, if it is not fulfilled a financial penalty will  be applied, is called uncertain, and concerning this the Sages said \"uncertain arrangements are not binding.\"  Another expression they use is \"any 'if not' is not binding.\"  Any condition, however, that a person makes with his fellow in the form of \"if you do such and such, I will do such and such,\" as people commonly create conditions, is not uncertain, for if it were how could we ever make conditional arrangements (as they all must be dependent on 'if' statements).  Moreover, what could we say about the many conditions that pertain to marriage and divorce?  They are all 'if' statements!  Rather, it must be as we said, that only punitive conditions are considered uncertain, such as \"if I don't pay you by day X the field will be yours,\" or whatever the collateral is, but not for the great many other conditions that people stipulate, such as \"if you go to place X I will give you sum Y,\" or \"If you do X for me I will give you 200 zuz\" etc.  Understand this, my son, give heart to it, and through this a heavy fog will be lifted from before your eyes in many issues in the Talmud.", 
            "They also said (Tamud, Bava Metziah 75b) that early or late interest is prohibited.  What does this mean?  If a person decided that he wanted to borrow money from someone and sent him gifts to encourage him to lend, this is early interest.  If he borrowed and returned the money, and then sent gifts in recognition of the fact that his money was idle, this is late interest.  Some authorities also said (Mishneh Torah, Laws of Creditor and Debtor 6:7) that if one lends money to his fellow with land that constantly produces value (like a courtyard, bathhouse or market stall), if it is done withut a discount it is genuine usury, and if there si a discount it is 'dust of usury'.  But if the loan is made with the land that does not constantly produce value (like a field or vineyard, as sometimes the expense involved exceeds the revenues) without a discount it is not usury, and with a discount it is permitted.  Other authorities say that the Sages even prohibited this latter case, and the only permissible form of collateral is the Syrian style, in which they would write, \"at the end of these years the land will transfer without funds.\"  In truth it seemed from the Talmud to our teachers (HaShem should keep them) according to the best explanations, that any collateral that is made with a discount, whether it is a house or bathhouse that produces profits, or a field or vineyard, it is all permitted with a discount.  This is the custom in our regions based on their words, and one who is concerned for the view of the great sages who were strict in this matter will be blessed from heaven. ...", 
            "What was prohibited by the Sages to avoid creating ruses?  If a person says to his fellow, \"lend me a manah [=100 zuz]\" and the other responds, \"I have no manah, but I have a manah worth of wheat.\"  If he then gives him the wheat and buys them back for 90, this would certainly be legal, but the Sages forbade it because it allows for a ruse of interest.  It is apparent that this is like usury, as this one gave 90 but will receive 100 in return, but if it was already done the court would extract the full 100, as this is not even the 'dust of interest'; it is only prohibited as a safeguard.  Also, if one had a field as collateral he may not rent it to its owner as this is also a ruse.  Similar cases are described in the Talmud (Talmud, Bava Metziah 68a).  Even though these are only forbidden as ruses, some other activities are permitted even though they seem like genuine usury.  The Sages permitted them because they could not lead to other transgressions.  For example, a person may sell debt at a discount, and he may also pay an agent to procure a loan from another Jew on his behalf.  The general principle is that the Torah only forbade interest that goes from the hand of the borrower to the lender.  This is because the Torah usually describes the dominant case and leaves out the details, and as the standard case is funds transferring directly from the borrower to the lender this is the command of the Torah.  Even though all this is true, any moral person should stay as far from any kind of usury ruses as possible.  Anyone who pursues vehicles to extract interest payments from another Jew will eventually see his fortune dwindle, as the Sages said, \"Anyone who deals in interest shrinks his portfolio.\"  (Talmud, Bava Metzia 71a)  They also said, \"A peruta of interest causes a loss of storehouses full of cash.\" (Talmud, Bava Metzia 75b)  Many more details are explained in the fifth chapter of Bava Metziah.", 
            "The mitzvah always applies to both men and women.  One who transgressed and loaned money with a prohibited form of interest has violated this commandment, and the money may be extracted by the court, directly from his assets, as is the law for theft and torts (according to the first view), or we may use coercive techniques to retrieve the money as is the law for one who refuses to fulfill a positive mitzvah (according to the view of my teachers).  If he loaned with a rabbinic form of 'the dust of interest' he has transgressed a rabbinic edict, but the money cannot be retrieved by the court.  If the borrower seized the interest amount from the lender we do not take it back from him.  If the interest was in the category of the ruse ,we obviously don't force the lender to return it and we even retrieve the money from the borrower if he seized it, as this was the arrangement that they agreed to.  Since this is only a stringency to avoid real situations of interest, we do not police it after the fact, which for this purpose is defined as when the conditions have been fulfilled by both parties."

It emerges that a person should be mindful of what he orders his Hebrew slave to perform, and this is part of the principle that the Sages said, \"one who acquires a Hebrew slave has acquired a master for himself.\" (Talmud, Kiddushin 22a) Nevertheless, the verse says that he will be a \"laborer and a worker with you,\" which implies that he may be ordered to perform all customary forms of work.  In general a free laborer is not employed for degrading work, nor is a migrant worker, who stays with the master and performs his work at will.  Therefor the Torah said that he should be like a worker, because these men, even though they do work, are usually not employed in slave-style labor.

Our Sages said (Talmud, Yebamot 48b) that when a Jew acquires a slave he has twelve months to convince him to abandon idolatry, get circumcised, immerse in the mikva, and accept the obligations that apply to a Jewish woman.  If he refuses, he may not stay longer than twelve months, and he must be sold immediately.  It is only those slaves that were circumcised and immersed that the commandment to 'work them forever' applies.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah - Since the People of Israel are the choicest specimens of humanity and they were created to recognize their Creatpr and serve Him, it is fitting that they should have slaves to serve them.  If they could not find slaves among the other nations, they would they need to enslave their brethren, who would then be unable to strive in the service of HaShem.  We were therefore commanded to retain those who serve us after we have readied them and removed idolatry from their mouths , lest they be a source of strife in our homes.  This is the meaning of the verse, \"And as for your brothers, the Children of Israel, a man unto his brother shall not impose hard labor.\"  That is, if we follow this we will not need to enslave our brethren, and everyone will be able to serve HaShem.  Even though the verse also teaches that a Hebrew slave cannot be subjected to hard labor, there are many meanings in every verse.", 
            "Given that the foundation of this mitzvah is the propagation of service of the Creator, the Sages permitted non-fulfillment of this mitzvah whenever its fulfillment would interfere with another mitzvah, even if it is only a rabbinic edict, such as forming a quorum in the Synagogue (cf Talmud, Berakhot 47b).  You should not wonder how we can forsake a biblical mitzvah in favor of a rabbinic one, because the foundation of the mitzvah is only the advancement of the service of HaShem, and manumitting in this case meets that end.  Moreover, the freed individual is now capable of fulfilling more mitzvot on his own, hence the Sages said (ibid.) that is is permissible to free him, as this is what they had received. ", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah - The Sages taught (Talmud, Kiddushin 22b) that he may acquire his freedom though payment, a writ, or an injury to a limb that will not heal (of which there are 24).  Even though he is granted freedom with such an injury we still require that the master compose a writ of manumission, and we force the master to do so after this kind of injury.  The Sages also said that (Talmud, Gittin 43b) one who sells his slave to non-Jews or Samaritans, or even to a resident alien, [effectively] frees his slave.  Also, a Jew who lives in Israel who sells his slave to another Jew who intends to take him out of Israel [effectively] frees his slave.  Similarly, the Sages taught (Talmud, Gittin 40a) that if his master marries him of to a free woman, or if he helps him don tefillin, or calls him up to read three verses before the congregation, or anything else that is only an obligation of free men, he has [effectively] freed him, and we force the master to compose a writ of manumission.  Therefore, the master must be careful to avoid doing any of these things so that he will not violate this mitzvah, unless it is done for the sake of another mitzvah (as we explained above).  The laws of the composition of the writ, as well as other details, are explained in Tractates Gittin and  Kiddushin.", 
            "The mitzvah always applies to both men and women, for even though woman are not permitted to purchase slaves because it aroused suspicion, if she did purchase one she would not be permitted to free him, and she must sell him instead.

A 'bowing stone' refers to a stone that is engraved with images.  Hewn stones that have been planed smooth are also included in this prohibition.",

They would place expertly engraved stones before the idols and they would prostrate upon them.  We might also explain that it seems like worshiping the stone itself; since the stone was prepared and beautified it arouses suspicion.  Bowing on clothing arouses no suspicion as clothing are easily destroyed and therefore unworthy of worhip, whereas a stone, which has both staying power and a corresponding angel in Heaven (as the Sages said (Talmud, Chullin 40a) \"Whether he speaks to the mountain or to 'Gada' of the Mount, which is the angel that is responsible for the mountains, he arouses suspicion.\") The Torah distances us greatly from anything that others might suspect as wrong, with the added purpose of preventing others from being misled by his actions.

            "From the laws of the mitzvah - The Sages said (Talmud, Megillah 22b) that one only incurs lashes if he spreads his arms and legs, which would then allow him to rest completely on the stone, as this is the accepted understanding of the word 'prostate' in the Torah.  If he did not spread out he is not flogged, but they would administer the 'rebel's beating.'  Within the context of actual idolatry there is no distinction between spread out and not spread; as soon as one bows his face to a foreign god he incurs the penalty of stoning Talmud, Horayot 4a).  The Sages also said (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Idolatry 6:7) that if he placed rugs on the stone and covered them, he may then prostate there.  They also said that the prohibition applies everywhere except the Temple, for in the Temple one may prostate one's self to HaShem on stones, as it says, \"do not place in your lands\" [which implies that] it is in your lands that you may not prostate, but you may prostate on the stone surfaces in the Temple.  This distinction may be understood based on the reason we have given, that people will suspect the prostrater of deifying the stones, and as the Temple is chosen for the service of HaShem, and it is as clear as day that the only worship that is performed there is directed to Him, there is no room for suspicion.  If, however, we follow Maimonides' rationale, that it is to distance us from what was an idolatrous practice, we should be even more careful in Temple to avoid corrupting the thoughts of the one who comes to prostrate himself to HaShem.  Still, I know that Maimonides had sound reasons for everything he said, and sometimes the inadequacies of the reader can confuse the matter.  More details are explained in Tractate Megillah.",

So it is written, \"When a person proclaims an oath of valuation of people to HaShem.\" (Lev. 27:2)  Valuations are part of the system of sacred oaths, and one is therefore obligated to keep thme from the general command of \"do not profane his words\" (Num. 30:3) and \"do not hesitate to fulfill it\" (Deut. 23:22) and \"do as you speak.\" (Num 30:3)",

That is, unless he explicitly states that the proscription be rendered unto HaShem, or to improve the Temple, as the Sages said, \"unspecified proscriptions are to to the kohanim\" (Talmud, Arakhin 28b).  This is apparent from the verse, \"like the proscribed field it shall be the allotment of the kohen.\"", 
            "From the root of the mitvzah: Israel is the nation that HaShem chose from all the other nations to serve Him and to recognize His Name, and they are not governed by the constellations that HaShem apportioned to all the other people. They are instead under His direct Providential Hand without any intermediary of an angel or fortune, as it is written, \"For HaShem is the portion of His people.\" (Deut. 32:9)  We see this in the story of the Exodus from Egypt, which was a miracle that included all the people, that He took them out by Himself in His glory, as the Sages derived from the verse, \"I will pass through Egypt\" (Ex. 12:12) - I will and not angel, \"I will strike the firstborns\" - I will and not one of the host, as we read in the Haggada.  Therefore, as long as Israel maintains the Torah and serves HaShem only goodness will come to them, and the flow of blessing and a pure benevolent spirit will support them, and the opposite, the curse and the 'proscription' will come to their enemies and antagonizers. As such, if one of them gets angry and pronounces words f curse and proscription on his property or land, which are included in this blessing, the verse teaches that one cannot remove the rights to it from the blessed one to another authority.  Everything that is owned by Israel, who is the portion of HaShem, is really His, as whatever a slave comes to possess belongs to his master (Talmud, Pesachim 88b). Still, since it is clear that the proscriber intends to remove the object form his possession, it is proper to allow his will to be fulfilled and return it to the possession of his Master, and it becomes sacred.   ", 
            "This is the meaning of the verse \"Anything that is proscribed among men shall not be redeemed and shall surely die\" (Lev. 27:29) which can be simply understood that is some foreign people are considered proscribed, in such cases as wars against enemies  where combatants might swear, \"if this nation is given into my hands I will proscribe their cities\" (Num. 21:2), they should die, as other nations are not included in the wellspring of blessing, as we have said.  The language of proscription [therefore] applies to them.  (This is the explanation of Nachmandies on this verse (Ramban on Leviticus 27:29)  (Even though there are many midrashic explanations, there are 70 faces to the Torah, they are all correct for the person who can understand these things.)  For this same reason the Sages said (Tamud, Arakhin 28a) that any property of the kohanim and levites is not subject to proscription, that is, even if the kohen or levi says that his field should be come proscribed, it has no effect.  He is like a person who dwells in his master's house, which is the place of blessing and kindness and good, as all his property already belongs to HaShem.  Amidst blessing there is no possibility of proscription.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah:  The Sages said (Talmud, Arakhin 28b) -  What distinguishes proscriptions that go to the kohen form those that go to HaShem?  The latter are sacred and are redeemed with their value, and the money then goes to the Temple treasury, and the object loses its sanctity.  The  kohen proscriptions, which are any unspecified proscription that automatically goes to the kohen, can never be redeemed, and they must be given to the kohen like termuah.  Concerning the proscriptions of the kohanim the verse says that they \"shall have no redemption.\"  They cannot be sold to another, and they cannot be redeemed [and retained] by the original owners.  Both land and movable property were given to the kohanim in the current service cycle at the time of proscription.  During the time that the original owner reatins the proscribed article it is treated as sacred for all purposes, as it is written, \"Anything proscribed is totally holy to HaShem.\" (Num 18:14)  Once it is given to the kohen it is completely ordinary, as it is written, \"All proscription in Israel shall be for you.\"  A field that is proscribed and given to a kohen never returns to the owners.  More details are explained in the eight chapter of Tractate Atrakhin and the first chapter of Tractate Nedarim.",

One who transgressed and proscribed his property and did not given them to the kohen or the Temple, as appropriate, has failed to fulfill this positive commandment, and he punishment is severe as he has embezzled sacred property."

As it is written, \"All of the tithes of your sheep and cows, whatever passes beneath the rod, the tenth shall be holy to HaShem.  (Lev. 27:32)  Our Sages explained (Bekhorot 58b) the process: The new animals are gathered into the pen and a small opening is made so as to prevent two animals from exiting at once.  The mother animals were then placed outside, and they would cal to their lambs who would then depart on their own volition.  They were then counted under the rod up to ten, and the tenth would be marked in red and called, \"this is the tithe.\"",

HaShem knows that most people are attracted by pleasures and vanities, as they are but flesh, and they will not be attentive to the Torah and those who are involved with it.  Therefore he gave them a place wherein everyone will necessarily know His Torah, for there is no doubt that people will live where their livelihood demands.  As such, when each person brings his cattle tithe each year to the place where Torah study and wisdom prevails, i.e. Jerusalem, the place of the Sanhedrin who know and explain the law, and when we similarly bring our grain tithes in four years of the seven year cycle, as we know that the second tithe is eaten there, and the first fruits of the fourth year of the tree, the owner of the property will need to go and learn Torah, or perhaps he will send one of his sons to study there and to use the produce as a stipend.",

Even if they heard the sage's words weekly, they would then go home and ignore everything he said.  When the teacher is in every house and stays there evening, morning and afternoon, and constantly reminds them, then all people will be careful and aware, and they will not sin at all.  Through this they will merit the words of the verse (Lev 26:11-12) \"I will place My dwelling amongst you,\" and (Jer. 11:4) \"And you will be for Me and nation, and I will be you Lord.\"",

One may not tithe from an animal born in one year for an animal born in another year, similar to the law that one may not tithe form old grain onto new and vice-versa, where it is written, \"which comes from your field each year\" (Deut 14:22).  Still, if one did tithe from the old animals and crops onto the new or vice-versa, Rambam (Laws of Firstborns, 7:5) wrote that he believes that the tithe is valid becasue of the severity of the tithes, as the verse is actually written with respect to grains, and we only need to be as strict as the rule there, where it is only a priori.",

Rather, it is permissible to slaughter and eat the lambs as desired, and when the ordained periods that the Sages have set for tithing arrive, tithe whatever remains.   Once those times ceom it is forbidden to eat or sell before tithing, but if one transgressed and slaughtered an animal, it is permissible.",

So that animals should be available for pilgrims, for even though it was permissible to sell the animals before tithing, people would wait and only sell them after tithing to allow the fulfillment of the mitzvah.  If one counted and erred, accidentally calling the eighth animal the tithe, or the twelfth, it is not sanctified, but of the error was on the ninth or eleventh, they are sacred, as we know from tradition.  (Bekhorot 23a)  The Sages also said (Bava Metziah 6b) that any animal about which there is a doubt as to whether it should be obligated in tithing is exempt from the tithe.  All animals, blemished and not, are brought into the pen for the counting, except for mixed species, mortally wounded, and very young ones, or an orphaned animal whose mother died in birth.

            "We are commanded to confess our sins before HaShem, at such time that we feel remorse for them.  The basic form of confession is to say as part of repentance, \"I have sinned in such and such ways.\"  The sin must be explicitly enunciated.  He should then seek atonement and extend his words in this matter according to his fluency.  The Sages taught that even sins that require the bringing of a sin-offering still demand confession with the offering, and on this the verse says, \"Speak to the children of Israel [saying], a man or woman who cimits any sin and rebels against HaShem, that soul is guilty and they should confess the sins that they did.\" (Num. 5:6)  The Sages taught in the Mechilta, \"Since it says 'confess the sin' (Lev. 5:5) it means that the sin must be extant, that is alive and not slaughtered.\"  This mean that the animal to be offered must still be alive.  They also said, \"We see that one must confess if he profanes the sacred.  How do you know that it includes all mitzvot?  (That is, since the verse is Vayikra only explicitly discussing profaning the sacred, how do we know to include all other mitzvot).  Form the verse, 'Speak to the children of Israel ...' (That is, we understand these two verses as if they were written as one.)  How do we know to include sins that are punishable by death?  From the confession of Aaron [which reads] 'for all their sins'.\"  The Sages used this verse to include all negative commandments, and the 'that they did' to include positive commandments, that is, any tome a person has the opportunity to fulfill a positive commandment and does not do so he must confess.  The also derived in the Mechilta from the verse \"all the sins of man\" that sins like theft and gossip also require confession, though he must also make amends, and if he does not do so it would be better not to confess. \"To rebel\" includes all those sentenced to death who must also confess.  I might have thought to include even those falsely convicted, that is, the condemned maintains hos innocence, and to demand that they confesss.  The verse teaches, \"the soul that is guilty\" to exclude the person who knows that is falsely convicted.  Hence we understand that all sins, large and small, must be confessed.", 
            "Since this mitzvah is attached to the obligation to bring an offering one might think that the confession is not an independent mitzvah, and see it only as an extension of the sacrifice and one of its requirements.  The Mechilta therefore had to explain that such is not the case, and it is indeed independent.  They taught, \"I might have thought that I only confess when they brought offerings, hence the verse teaches, 'the children of Israel will confess.'\"  This  implies that they had a tradition to understand the verse in this way.   Still, I might have thought that confession only applies in Israel, that is, even though one may confess without the sacrifice it is still limited to Israel, as that is the locus of atonement.  How do I know to include the Diaspora?  From the verse, \"They will confess their sins and the sins of their forebearers.\"  That is, the forebearers who were exiled for their sins.  Daniel also said in the Diaspora (Dan. 9:7) \"For You HaShem, is the righteousness and for us is the shame on this day.\"  We see that confession is an independent mitzvah that applies in all places.  The Sifra also taught, \"'They will confess' refers to verbal confession.\"", 
            "The root of this mitzvah. Through verbal confession of sin, the sinner reveals his thoughts and feelings: that he truly believes that all his deeds are revealed and known before the Blessed God, and that he will not act as if “the Eye that sees” does not see. Furthermore, through mentioning the sin specifically, he will feel remorseful about it, and he will be more careful on another occasion not to stumble in the same way again. After he declares verbally ‘I did such-and-such, and I stumbled in my deeds’ he should create barriers so he won’t repeat what he did, and through this he will be wanted by his Blessed Creator. And the Good God, the One who Wants Goodness for His Creations makes them walk in this way, and provides it. "

            "From the root of the mitzvah: I already wrote in the introduction to this work that this world was created by HaShem with something that combines physicality and intellect, and that is Man. It is therefore fitting for the dignity of HaShem that this creature attain the most complete level of understanding that can be achieved, as I wrote above.  There is no doubt that without this reason that the intellect is forced to combine with the physical, which is in a state of perpetual sinful baseness, the intellect should be close to HaShem and in praise of Him, recognizing His Honor like one of the ministering angels.  Still, since the intellect does live within the physical it must occasional tend to the needs of its landlord, for a house of sticks and stones cannot stand without a person minding it.  If so, as man is created in the manner described, whenever the intellect can suppress the physical and focus on the service of its Master it is good for it, so long as it does not completely ignore the  work of the house and destroy it.  This would also be considered sinful as the King wished the creature to function in this way.  It is like the saying of Rabbi Yosi, (Ta'anit 22b) that a person may not afflict himself on a fast day, which Rav Yehudah explained in the name of Rav as stemming from the verse \"and man was a living thing\" (Gen 2:7), which implies that the soul should be allowed to live.  On the same basis the wise king said, \"Do not be overly righteous; do not be overly wise.  Why should you be desolate?\" (Ecc. 7:15)  This is the holiness of the Nazir as he departs form the physical.  On this Simon the Just1 said: In the whole of my life, I ate of the guilt-offering of a defiled nazirite [only once].  This man who came to me from the South country, had beauteous eyes and handsome features with his locks heaped into curls. I asked him: 'Why, my son, didst thou resolve to destroy such wonderful hair?' He answered: 'In my native town. I was my father's shepherd, and, on going down to draw water from the well, I used to gaze at my reflection [in its waters]. Then my evil inclination assailed me, seeking to compass my ruin,  and so I said to it, \"Base wretch! Why dost thou plume thyself on a world that is not thine own, for thy latter end is with worms and maggots. I swear  I shall shear these locks to the glory of Heaven!\"' Then I rose, and kissed him upon his head. and said to him: 'Like unto thee, may there be many nazirites in Israel. Of such as thou art, does the verse say, When a man shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite to consecrate himself unto the Lord.' [trans Soncino - http://halakhah.com/nazir/nazir_4.html#PARTb]  Therefore, in order to suppress the evil inclination, the Nazir is told to shave his head and not to fix it up to the way it was before.  He must shave it all for there is no doubt that both very long hair and shaven heads are destructive to the appearance of a person.", 
            "Do not argue with me with the Sages satement (Nazir 19a), \"He must bring an atonement offering for he pained himself by avoiding wine\" for this also works with my explanation.  We have already said that a person does not have the right to destroy the house that was built by the First Architect, for perhaps this person has overstepped this boundary and harmed his body.  Perhaps being a Nazir is damaging to this individual's constitution, as all the ways of HaShem are righteous and the just follow them.  Nachmanides explained simply (Rambam on Num 6:11) that the sin-offering is for returning to ordinary life and the desires of the world.  Since this person had once had a 'spirit of HaShem' and became a Nazir, he should have stayed that way for his whole life.  There are 70 faces to the Torah.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages taught (Nazir, 39a) that is the Nazir shaves with or wothout intent, or even if it is an accident, his count of Nazirite days is over and he must count another 30 days (as we know that a standard Nazir period is 30 days (Nazir, 5a)) so that he has a lock.  When is this true?  If the majority of his head was shaved with a razor tosomething like it and there was no longer enough hair to fold over to the root. If only the minority was shaved he does not lose his count, just as he does not lose his count by drinking wine even for several days, though he does lose it by becoming impure as the verse describes.",

For instance, if a person had a speech impediment, or lived in a place where everyone has a speech impediment, and they say 'nazik' ir 'nazich' or 'pazich', and he said about himself \"I will be a pazich\" etc., he is a Nazir.  We do not say that the formulation in his intent and his vocalized intent must match, as we do for oaths.  Once he has decided to become a Nazir and he says something that demonstrates that intent, even thought he words themselves do not positively identify him as a Nazir, it is effective.   They also said that adjuct expressions are effective, which describe a case where a person says \"I shall be\" as a Nazir passes before him.  Or if he says, \"I will be beautiful\" and holds his hair, he is a Nazir.  Or if he says, \"I will be a Nazir from grape flesh, or shaving only, or impurity, he is a complete Nazir.  If he says, \"I will be a Nazir on the condition that I will drink wine\", or become impure, or shave, he is a Nazir, and all are prohibited, because a condition which violates the laws of the Torah is cancelled.  One may reneg on a Nazir vow in the same way that one renegs on any vow.  A father may make a Nazirite oath for his son up until age thirteen, but the mother may not, and this is our tradition.  Non-Jews are not subject to the rules of Nazir, though women and slaves are.  A husband or father may annul the Nazir vow of his wife or daughter like other oaths, as may a master force his slave to drink wine or become impure.", 
            "The mitzvah that a Nazir must grow his hair always applies to men and women.  Even though the Sages taught (Nazir 19b) that Nazir only applies in Israel, that is that a person must observe his days of Nazir in Israel, and the days that he is a Nazir outside of Israel do not count in his tally, still, he must observe the rules of Nazir outside of Israel as well.  Therefore, id one made a Nazir oath today he is a permanent Nazir, as we have no ability to offer the sacrifices at the end of the period.  The Sages also taught that we coerce the Nazir to go to Israel and to fulfill his Nazir vow there until he dies or until the Temple is rebuilt an "

            "The Kohanim are commanded to carry the Ark on their shoulders when the People of Israel move it from one place to another, as it is written, \"For the holy works shall be carried on their shoulders\" (Num 7:9).  Maimonides wrote (Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Commandment 34) that even though this mitzvah is given to the Levites, that was only in the desert, for their were only a few Kohanim.  In future generations the Kohanim were obligated in this mitzvah as is apparent from Joshua (Joshua 3:6) and Samuel.", 
            "Nachmanides wrote that it is not true that the mitvzah was moved to the Kohanim, God forbid that we should ever say that any mitzvah in the Torah changed, and that the Levites should be disqualified from carrying the Ark.  He seems correct, and we see that the Levites did carry the Ark during the tome of King David, as it is written, \"And HaShem assisted the Levites who were carriers of the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem\" (I Chron. 15:26), and it says, \"And all the Levites were carrying the Ark ...\"  In truth, even though both the Koahnim and Levites are accpetable for carrying the Ark as far as the Torah is concerned, as they are all called Levites, as in the verse \"the Levitical Kohanim\" (Ez. 44:15), and also \"And the Kohanim and Levites sanctified themselves to carry the Ark of HaShem the Lord of Israel and Moshe had commanded by the word of HaShem, with the poles on their shoulders\" (I Chron. 15:14-15).  The Sifrei explains, \"Where was the command?  [From the verse] \"and to the sons of Kehat was not given any other ....\" as they are all called the descendants of Kehat.  Nachmanides also wrote that Maimonides' proofs from Joshua and Samuel are not so clear, and in fact indicate the opposite, as it is written there, \"and he commanded the people saying, 'When you see the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem that is carried by the Kohanim, Levites\" (Joshua 3:3).  The truth is as we have said, that the whole tribe is eligible to carry the Ark, and this is explained further is the Talmud (Sotah 33b) where the Sages say, \"How did the Israelites cross the Jordan?  Every day the Levites carried the Ark, and on this day it was carried by the Kohanim.\"  That is, on the day that they crossed the Jordan the Kohanim carried it alone, as it is written, \"And Joshua said to the Kohanim, 'Carry the Ark of the Covenant'\" so that the miracle would be done by the Kohanim, as they are the holiest members of the tribe.", 
            "It also seems that Maimonides' explanation fo this verse in Joshua is not clear at all, as we have said.  And the verse in Kings that says, \"And the Kohanim brouh the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem to its place, to the Holy of Holies\" (I Kings 8:1) should also not pose a problem, because the Levites were not permitted to enter the Holy of Holies; that was limited to thew Kohanim.  The main point seems to confirm the view of Nachmanides, that the entire tribe may carry the Ark, as is clear from the verse, \"And he said to the Levites ... place the Holy Ark in the Temple that was built by Solomon son of David, the king of Israel, there is no longer a burden on your shoulders\" (II Chron. 35:3).  Furthermore, this indicates that the people would have no more need to carry the Ark form one place to another, but it does not indicate that if it were to move it would not be done by the Levites, and this is clear and obvious to all.  The Sages said (Chullin 24a) that blemishes disqualify the Kohanim but years do not - it is only the priestly duties that are not affected by age, but age does indeed disqualify for  the labor of carrying, as is the rule for the Levites.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah: The main glory of Israel is the Torah which makes us distinct from other peopels and the portion of HaShem, and it is therefore proper that it should be carried by the most dignified and holy people among us.  I have need to elaborate on matters that any school child can understand.  The performance of the mitzvah is expressed in the verse, and that is that the Kohanim and Levites would carry the Ark on their shoulders whenever it moved form place to place, such as during war or some other time, and it would not be put on a wagon or the back of an animal.  The Sages indicted David for a mistake that even children know to avoid, as he palced the Ark on a wagon (Sotah 34a).", 
            "The mitzvah applied when the People of Israel lived in their land, for then there was [occasional] need to carry the Ark of the Covenant of HaShem for war or by the command of the king.  Today, in our sinfulness, we have no king and no Ark to carry in any place.  The mitzvah applies to all the Levites and to the rest of the people to support them.  The contemporary practice in the Diaspora of bringing the Torah to greet the non-Jewish kings is not governed by this mitzvah at all, and any Jew may carry it.  If as a way of showing honor to the Torah they choose a Levite even today, may blessing come upon them."

            "Anyone who was unable to offer the first Paschal offering on the fourteenth day of Nissan ,for example, due to ritual impurity or distance, is commanded to offer the second Paschal offering on the fourteenth day of Iyar.   As it is written, \"On the second month on the fourteenth day, in the afternoon, you shall offer it.\" (Num. 9:11)  Our Sages also taught (Pesachim 73a) that it is not limited to ritual impurity or distance, but any case of inadvertency or accident, or even if onr willfully refused to offer the first one, may offer the second one.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah: The Psachal offering is a powerful and clear sign to all of the creation of the world.  For at that time the great and mighty God performed miracles for us and changed the rules of Nature in public view, and all the peoples of the Earth saw his Providence and Omnipotence, and at that time everyone believed and all who followed them knew that the Blessed One created the word ex nihilo at the time that He chose.  That was the Age of Knowledge, for even though creation ex nihilo defies the laws of physics, splitting the sea to allow the passage of a great assemblage of people is too, as is sustaining a large population for forty years on heavenly bread, and all the other signs and miracles that He performed for us at that time as they all changed the order of Nature and indicated something new happening.  This is the firmest pillar of our faith and our Torah, for people who believe in the eternity of the universe have no stake in the Torah and no place in the World to Come.  This is known and there is no need to elaborate on well known matters.  Therefore, HaShem wished to allow everyone Jew to merit in this important mitzvah, and circumstances should not prevent its fulfillment, and if something prevents a person form fulfilling it in the first month, they may do so in the second.  Since this is a fundamental basis in our religion the obligation extends even to a person who converted between the two months, or a child who reacehd maturity in this window, that is, they must bring the second Paschal offering.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages taught (Pesachim 95a) that the differences between the first and second offerings are as follows - On the first all leaven is forbidden to be kept in one's possession, while on the second both leaven and matza may be in the house.  The second lasts for only one day, and there is no prohibition against performing labor. The forst requires that Hallel be recited while eating it, the second does not, though both require Hallel during the offering.  Both are eaten with matza and marror, as is explicit in the verse.  Both supercede the observance of the Shabbat, and neither may be left over or have bones broken in them, as the verse explicitly prohibits by saying, \"do not leave over\" and \"do not break a bone in it.\"", 
            "If you ask why they are not completely equal, as the verse does expressly state with respect to the second Paschal offering, \"according to all the laws of the Paschal offering shall you make it,\" you should know that the Sages already raised this question (Pesachim 95a) [and answered] that the verse refers only to details that pertain to the body of the Paschal offering, such as eating it with matza and marror, not leaving any over, and not breaking bones, as we have explained.  They derived this from the fact that the verse singled out a few laws, while if the laws were truly identical it would have been sufficient to simply state, \"perform it according to the laws of the Paschal offering.\"  They said, \"Just as the bone is remakable in that is part of the body, so too anthying, etc.\"", 
            "Also included in this mitzvah is the Sages statement (Pesachim 93a) that an impure person is delayed to the second Paschal day, which referred to someone who is impure in a severe way that prevents him from eating the Paschal offering, such as someone who experienced a flow, or a menstruant, or a new mother, or someone who became impure through contact with the dead under circumstances that would require a Nazirite to halt his period of Nazir, or if he touched a carcass or a vermin, or something like it.  Even if he will immerse in the mikva on the fourteenth before the time of the offering, and he only needs to wait until evening to complete his purification when he would be allowed to eat the Paschal lamb.  Also included in this mitzvah is the Sages statement (Pesachim 93b) that a 'far distance' in this context means anything that is fifteen mil outside of the walls of Jerusalem, but less than that is not called a far distance.  More details are explained in Tractate Pesachim.", 
            "The mitzvah applied when the Temple stood to men as an obligation, and as a voluntary offering for women, as the Sages said (Pesachim 91b), that women who do not make the first offering may offer on the second if they wish to, and for this reason we may not offer on their behalf on the Shabbat.  A man who willfully did not fulfill this mitzvah and did not bring the second Paschal offering after he was unable to offer the first, incurs Spiritual Death, as this is the view of Rabbi [Yehudah HaNasi] in the mishnah (Pesachim 93a). Rabbi Natan, Rabbi Chaninah and Rabbi Akiva ll exempt him from Spiritual Death as he was not willful in the first case.  We need not say that of he deliberately did not offer the first time,, and he was also did not bring the second offering, whether willfully or not, that he incurs Spiritual Death according to all, as he deliberately failed to offer the sacrifice to HaShem in its proper time.  This is one of two positive commandments for which the punishment is Spiritual Death, as we explained in Parashat Bo (Sefer HaChinukh : Mitzvah 5)."

            "We are commanded to sound trumpets in the Temple each day as every sacrifice is offered, and also at time of trouble.  On this it is written, \"And when a war befalls ...\" and \"and on you festivals, holidays and new moons you shall sound trumpets on your burnt and peace offerings\" (Num. 10:9-10).  Even though the verse describes a holiday, this is not precise, and it applies every day for every sacrifice.  It is explained in the Talmud (Rosh HaShannah 29a), that everyone is obligated in the sounding of the Shofar, Kohanim, Levites, and Israelites.  The Talmud asks if this is not obvious (for who else might be obligated), andas  it responds that that we might have thought that Kohanim should be exempt as they are obligated in the regular sounding of the whole year, as  is written in this verse.  The Talmud then asks if they are really similar, as one is a trumpet and the other a shofar, but nevertheless, we see from here that trumpets were a daily feature of the Temple.  The Tamlud also says (Arakhin 13a) that there were always between 21 and 48 trumpets blasts in the Temple.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah: A requirement of the sacrifice is that those present focus their attention, as it is well known that improper thoughts disqualify the offering and that offerings require complete awareness of the One who commanded that they be brought.  It is also essential during times of distress for a person to appeal before his Creator for mercy and salvation.  We are therefore commanded to sound trumpets at these times, for people in all their physicality demand noticeable calls to matters of importance, for the way of nature is to stand asleep.  Nothing is as stirring as the sound of instrumentation, as is well known, and this is well achieved through trumpets, which are the loudest of all musical instruments.  Another purpose, aside from focusing attention, is also realized through the trumpet, and that is the removal of all worldly concerns from the heart of the listener, such that no thoughts other than the offering remain.  Why should I go on so long?  This is well known to anyone who has ever paid attention to the sound of a trumpet or a shofar.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages said (Menachot 28a) that the trumpets were hammered from pure silver, as the verse describes, and all other metals are disqualified.  They also said (Arakhin 13a) that there were always at least two trunpets in the Temple and never more than 120.  Other details are explained in the Sifrei (Ba'ha'a'lotcha 77).  In  Tractate Rosh HaShannah ( Rosh HaShannah 26b)  and Ta'anit (Ta'anit 19a) the Sages explained the command to sound the trumpet during times of distress.", 
            "The mitzvah applied to Kohanim when the Temple stood, for they were commanded to sound the trumpets as is described in the movements of the encampments of Israel, \"And the sons of Aharon will sound the trunpets.\"  You might think that the Levites should sound the trumpets for the sacrifices, but this is not correct as the Sages explicitly said (Mishnah, Tamid 7:3), \"After the wine was poured as a libation the S'gan stood on the corner with the kerchief in his hand, and two Kohanim stood with trumpets in the their hands, the blasted, sounded and blasted.\"  It is clear that this mitzvah was consistently performed by the Kohanim, every day and not only on holidays.  However, I have seen that Rambam wrote (Mishnah Torah, Laws of Utensils of the Temple 3:5) that \"on all the festivals and the New Moon the Kohanim would sound the trumpets and the Levites would sing.\"  It seems from his language that he thought that on other days even the Levites could sound the trumpets.  If they transgressed and did not sound during the offering of a sacrifice or a time of distress, they have failed to fulfill this positive commandment."

It turns out that an eifah is 432 eggs, one-tenth of which is 43.2 eggs, and that is the volume of dough for the purposes of Challah.", 
            "From the root of the commandment - since the life of a person is dependent on food, and most of the world subsists on bread, Hashem desired to give us merit with a constant commandment in our bread, so that blessing should be placed in it through the commandment, and through it, we will accept merit in our souls. It turns out that the dough is food for our body and food for our soul. Additionally, so that the servants of Hashem, those that constantly strive in His work - and these are the Kohanim - should live without any toil at all. Whereas by the Terumah of the silo there is work for them, to pass the grain through the sieve and to grind it, here, their food will come to them without any pain whatsoever.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah:  The Sages said (Mishnah, Challah 3:1) that the obligation begins not from the the time that the flough is placed into the bowl, but from the the timed that it is kneaded, that is, from the time that the water is mixed in.  The five types of grain that are obligated in Challah are wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye, for it says, \"and whe you eat from the bread of the land.\" 'Bread' refers only to doughs made from these, and they all may be added to the necessary volume.  If one did not separate Challah from the dough he may take it from the bread, as it says, \"when you eat from the bread,\" implying that bread is still obligated.  Even if one first kneaded a quantity that was insufficient to be obligated in Challah, if he then kneaded another batch such that the two combine to the requisite volume, if they are then put into the same vessel they are obligated in Challah.  I heard from my teacher, May God protect him, that this is only if the bread was taken from the oven and put into a vessel that has a trench, but if it was placed on a board or on the floor, or anything else that has no inside, even though they were subsequently placed into a basket, they are already exempt from Challah.  This is what they meant when they said, \"one who removes it into a basket;\" it is only if it went from the oven to the basket.  It should also be clear that that the oven does not serve to combine the batches.  The pebbles that are in the dough are counted toward the total volume is they are not sifted, but if they are sifted and then added back in, they do not count to the total.", 
            "The amount to be given for Challah is not specified in the Torah, and even if one separated only a barley-corn from the the whole dough it would satisfy the law of Challah, as the Torah only says, \"The first of your dough shall be a gift,\" thus anything that is given as a gift suffices.  The Sages however said (Mishnah, Challah 2:7) that 1/24th should be given, which they based upon the continuation of the verse, \"give to HaShem.\"They understood this to mean that the gift should be dignified, and this was the amount that they estimated.  A baker who prepares his dough for sale in the market whose quantities are larger, and he also needs to make a profit, needs only give 1/48th.  Whether it should happen that the professional prepares a small amount or the home baker prepares a large amount, the percentages do not change.",

The law does snot follow the view (Pesachim 37a) that bread must be baked in an oven.  But if one prepares dough that will be dried in the sun or boiled in a pot it is not obligated in Challah.",

Dough that is made for animals is exempt from Challah, but is it is for both human and animal consumption it is obligated in Challah (Mishnah, Challah 1:8)  If dough from which Challah had been separated was mixed with dough from which Challah was not separated, what is to be done?  A new dough is brought and placed next to the two, and he takes Challah form this new dough for all three.  If there is no other dough available he should take Challah from the mixture without blessing, for all of it has been rendered 'unseparated'.  Even a small amount can render a large amount 'unseparated' if it is mixed in, for 'unseparated' material creates a prohibition at any proportion, as I wrote above (Sefer HaChinukh 284).  More details are explained in Tractate Challah and Tractate Orlah.", 
            "The mitvah applies to both men and women in Israel on a Torah level. This is based on the verse, \"when you eat from the bread of the land.\"  It is also limited to the time that the majority of the people of Israel are there, as it says, \"when you come\" which the Sages explained (Ketubot 20a) to mean that \"all of you\" and not some you are there.  On a Rabbinic level we are obligated to separate Challah even outside of Israel, so that the rules of separating Challah will not be forgotten by the people.  Because it serves only as a reminder we take some leniencies with the law, such as only separating a small amount from a large dough, and discarding of it in fire, and not giving it to any kohen, child or adult.  I have heard that in some places they still separate Challah according to the old proportions, and they give it a pre-pubescent kohen boy or girl, or even to a an old kohen who is passed the age of virility. Even though he is impure due to contact with the dead, he may still eat it according to those practices.  It also seems that another leniency outside of Israel is that one may deliberately be cancelled by majority, as the Talmud explains (Bekhorot 27a).  I do not believe the same applies to other prohibitions in the Torah, with the exceptions wood that fell into a fire pit on a festival which can have other wood added to it to cancel those, as they said (Beitzah 4b), \"a person may add wood to them permit them.\"  they explained that the reason is the prohibited portion is consumed by fire, and we can therefore be lenient.", 
            "Rambam wrote that today when there is no pure dough because contact with the dead, Challah is separated once in all Israel, which is 1/48th, and it is burned because it is impure. This has a basis in the Torah .  From Keziv to Amnah a second Challah is separated and given to the kohen, but this has no required amount as was the original law.", 
            "Challah outside of Israel, even though it is impure, is not prohibited to be consumed by a kohen unless he has impurity that emits from his body, as it is only a rabbinic decree.  Therefore only those who have seen seminal emissions or gonorrhea, or mestruant women or those who have recently birthed, or lepers, may not eat it.  Therefore, if there was a kohen child outside of Israel, whether in Syria or elsewhere, if they want to they may separate one Challah as 1/48th and it may be eaten by a pre-pubescent child, boy or girl, and there is no need to do a second separation to burn it.  Also, if there is a kohen man who is no longer virile, even if it is the same day that he immersed in the mikvah, and even though he is impure from contact with the dead, he may eat this first Challah, and there is no need to do a second separation outside of Israel."

            "We are obligation commanded to put fringes on the clothes that we wear, as it is written, \"and they shall make fringes for themselves.\" (Num. 15:18)  This obligation applies to garments with four or more corners, as it is written, \"on the four corners of your garment\" (Deut. 22:12)  'Four' includes five or more, provided that the garment is large enough that the head and most of the body of a child who is old enough to walk in the marketplace unescorted can be wrapped in it.  It seems that this age is around six or seven years old.  The garment must be made of wool or linen to be obligated in tzitzit when it is worn.  If it is missing one of these conditions, i.e. if it has fewer than four corners or is not as large as described, or it is or made from some other material, it is exempted from tzitzit on a Torah level.  Silk, camel hair, rabbit hair, and goat hair are all exempted from tzitzit on a Torah level, as 'garment' in the Torah refers only to those made from sheep's wool or linen, as is also the case for tzara'at of clothing.", 
            "The root of the mitzvah is explicit in the verse.  It is to provide us with a constant reminder of the commandments of HaShem, and there is no better reminder in the world than carrying the seal of the Master on one's clothes at all times, as a person is always attentive to his clothes.  This is what the verse means, “and you will recall all the mitzvot of HaShem” (Num 15:39).  The Sages (Tanchuma, Korach 12) wrote that 'tzitzit' alludes to the 613 commandments when combined with the eight strings and five knots.  I also feel that there is another reminder here that the soul and body of Man belong to HaShem.  The white portion corresponds to the body which is from the land that is made of snow, as we find in the Midrash (Pirka D'Rebbi Eliezer, 3), “Where is the land from?  From the snow that is under the Holy Throne.”  The threads also allude to the body, as they said that the initial formation of a body is but threads, as we find in the Talmud (Niddah 25b), “Rabbi Amram taught: the two legs are like two strands of silk, as are the arms.”  The blue portion which looks like the sky hints to the soul which is from on high,which the Sages implies when they said (Menachot 47b), “What is so unique about t'chelet?  T'chelet is like the sea, and the sea is like the sky, and the sky is like the Holy Throne, as it is written, 'And they saw the Lord of Israel …' (Ex 24:10) and 'The throne appeared as sapphire' (Ezek. 1:26).”  The souls of the righteous are stored underneath the throne and this is why the Sages said (Menachot 39a) that the t'chelet is wrapped around the white, as the soul is above and the body below.  They said that it is wound seven ar thirteen times to allude to the heavens and the divisions between them, as the Sages said, “One who wishes to do fewer should not go lower than seven, nor should he add more than thirteen, corresponding to the seven heavens and the six air-spaces between them.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah: The Sages said (Menachot 43b) that is a garment has five or more corners we only put tzitzit in the four most distant corners.  They also said (Menachot 28a) that all four tziztit are one mitzvah and are all required to fulfill the mitzvah.  They also said (Menachot 38a) that the t'chelet is a separate mitzvah from the white strings, which does not mean that they are actually counted as two mitzvot, but it means that is one is missing the other can still be a fulfillment of a mitzvah.  This is the case today where we cannot find t'chelet; we should still not hesitate to put white fringes without t'chelet onto our garments.  Also, when the t'chelet is available, if one has no white strings he may place the t'chelet on his garment and wear it with a blessing.", 
            "The t'chelet dye that we are commanded to use, which is similar to a pure blue sky, is made from the blood of a fish called chilazon, whose blood looks like the bottom of the ocean (Menachot 44a).  It is found in the Dead Sea area, and it was used to dye wool.  For many years we have not heard of anyone using this dye.  It muse be dyed for the sake of the mitzvah, and the white strings must be spun for the sake of the mitzvah.  We may not use wool that was caught in a thicket or from skin that was torn from the animal, or from the remnant  left over from the loom, or from stolen wool or wool from a city of idolaters, or from sacred wool.  If any of these was used it is disqualified.  Tzitzit that were spun by a non-Jew are disqualified, as it is written, “Speak to the Children of Israel … and they shall make.”  If a Jew made them without proper intention it is acceptable.  I have heard from great scholars that tzitzit made by a women are disqualified.", 
            "How are the tzitzit made?  Four strings are fed through the corner of the garment , such that there are now eight ends hanging from the corner.  This is not done precisely at the corner, but a half-thumbs distance from the edge, as Rabbi Yaakov and Rabbi Yochanan said in the Talmud (Menachot 42a), “It must be one large joint away.”  One of the stings should be longer so that it can be used for winding the others.  Five double knots are tied, and between each knot three spaces are left, and between the final knot four spaces, so that there are a total of thirteen spaces.  The strings are made long so that at least two thirds of the length are free hanging.  This is the ideal fulfillment of the mitzvah.  But as a basic fulfillment even one space suffices, and even if the strings shorten, even so far as there is only enough to make a basic bow it is acceptable. (Menachot 38b).  But if one string is completely missing it is disqualified.", 
            "One who owns a four cornered garment is not required to put tzitzit on it so long as he does not wear it.  The law follows the view of Rav who said, (Menachot 42a) that tzitzit is an obligation n the wearer, meaning that the obligation is for a perosn to put tzitzot on a garment when he wears it, but a garment that is sitting in a drawer does not need tzitzit.  The law does not follow the other view that it is an obligation on the garment itself, which would mean that is a person owns many four cornered garments he would have to ensure that they all have tzitzit.  This is not the case, as thr law follows Rav.", 
            "If one has a linen garment he should place linen tzitzit in it, for the law does not follow the view of Beit Shammai who taught (Menachot 40a) that linen garments are exempted from tzitzit.  They held that since a linen garment could never have t'chelet on it because of sha'atnez (as t'chelet must always be wool for the dye to absorb properly, which is the Torah's intention), even white linen strings are not put on.  This is what they meant when they said that Beit Shammai exempts linen in tzitzit, but the law does not follow them.  They did not derive laws from adjacent verses, but we follow Beit Hillel who did, and they therfore held that there is no problem of sh'atnez in tzitzit, as the Torah says, “Do not wear sha'atnez.  Make fringes for yourself” (Deut 22:11).  This implies that you may make your tzitzit from ?sha'atnez, and Beit Hille therefore believed that linen garments are obligated in tzitzit, and the law follwos them.  Still, we do not put t'chelet on a linen garment due to a concern about indigo, that is, lest a non-t'chelet dye be used and then it would be sha'atnez without the performance of a mitzvah.  The Talmud asked why it is not enough for the white strings to be the fulfillment of the mitzvah?  That is, even if it is indigo the sha'atnez problem is still surmounted by the white strings, as it is acceptable to use tzitzit that are sha'atnez!  They answered that Beit Hillel permitted sha'atnez in tzitzit on the strength of the verse only in cases where there are no alternatives, e.g. placing wool t'chelt in a linen garment, which is necessarily a combination of wool and linen.  In such cases Beit Hillel rely on the verse and obligated the use of t'chelet in a linen garment.  If however, there are other options, such as a case where one wishes to use white strings without t'chelet in a linen garment, it is not acceptable to use wool on the strength of the verse, as those white strings can be made of linen.  This follow the principle of Reish Lakish who said that in any case where it is possible to maintain both the positive and negative commandments it is ideal, an only otherwise do we say that the positive commandment supersedes the negative.  In this case it is possible to  maintain both commandments, for if you do not wish to place t'chelet with the white, linen suffices, and if you elect to use wool you have violated the law of sha'atnez and nothing else.  Because there are many interpretations of this discussion I have spent some time on it, and from what I found in my trap I have set the table for you.  If you merit you will understand the truth, and if you perhaps find valid reason to challenge my words in this matter my son you should not mind the honor of your father, and I will then read your destruction of the building.", 
            "Realize that even though the Torah only requires this mitzvah from one who wears a four cornered garment, like the requirement to build a fence that only applies to a person who has a roof, the Sages still extolled the value of this mitzvah and said (Menachot 41a) that one should pursue.  They also said (Shabbat 32b) that a person who is careful in the fulfillment of this mitzvah will merit to be waited upon by many servants, as the Torah equated it to and depended upon it the fulfillment of all the other mitzvot, as it says, “And you will see it and remember all the mitzvot of HaShem.”  Rabbi Elazar said that one who is careful in this and teffilin and mezuzah is assured that he will never sin, as it is written, “The three fold thread will not easily break” (Ecc. 4:12).", 
            "The laws of this mitzvah are found in the fourth chapter of Menachot.", 
            "The mitzvah always applies to men but not to women.  If women wish to wear tzitzit they may do so without a blessing according to some views.  Other views hold that they do recite the blessing.  One who transgressed and wore  his own wool or linen garment that meets the size requirements above without tzitzit has failed to fulfill this positive commandment.  If it is made from other materials he has failed to fulfill a rabbinic commandment.  If it is not his own garment but is instead borrowed, it is exempt for the first thirty days of the loan, and is obligated from the thirtieth day forward."

            "We are not to  follow the whims of our heart and the lusts of our eyes as it is written, \"Do not stray after your hearts and your eyes.\" (Num. 15:39)  The general sense of this commandment is that we should not dedicate our thoughts to the pursuit of ideas that are antithetical to the ones on which the Torah is built, as that may lead one to apostasy.  If, however, the the desire to pursue these thoughts should arise, one should try to resolve them cursorily, and redouble his efforts to contemplate the true and good ways of the Torah.  Similarly, a person should not pursue the things that one sees, principally meaning earthly desires, for in the end they are all evil and 'there is much shame and wrath.'  The Sages expressed this in their statement (Berachot 12b), \"'Do not stray after your hearts' refers to apostasy.  'After your eyes' refers to licentiousness, as it is written, 'And Samson said to his father, 'Take her for me, as she is right in my eyes.' (Jud. 14:3)\"", 
            "The root of this mitzvah is clear, as it protects a person from sinning against HaShem for all his days.  This mitzvah is really a fundamental principle in our religion, as evil thoughts are the antecedent to impurity, and the actions are their descendants.  If a person dies before having children their is no record of the progeny, so it emerges that this prohibition os the root of all good that comes from it.  Understand my son, and let it be your slogan, that the Sages said, \"One sin leads to another, and one mitzvah leads to another\" (Avot 4:2).  If you allow yourself to fulfill your evil fantasies even one time, you will inevitably do so many times.  If you merit to be a hero in the land and to conquer your evil inclination and close your eyes to the evil sights even one time, it will be easier for you to do so many times.  Lust pulls the body like wine draws the drinker. Drunkards can never be sated by wine, and they always want more, and the more they give in to their urge the stronger the urge becomes.  If they would drink some water it could extinguish their fire of desire and make it bearable for them.  The same is true here: The more a person allows himself to be governed by his urges and to allow them to become habit, the stronger his evil inclination becomes.  And the more he avoids them and appreciates what he has each day, he will see that HaShem made people the right way and that all of their schemes are completely pointless.",

One is not flogged for this because there is no specific deed for which the transgressor be can be warned, as people are made in such a way that it is impossible for them to see only exactly what they need, and similarly to never overreach in their speculations, so it is impossible to define precisely what the boundaries for conduct should be.  Also, this ca be transgressed without any deed at all, and I wrote earlier (Sefer HaChinukh 346) that for any prohibition that can be transgressed without a deed, even if a person does a deed in his particular transgression it seems he is still not flogged"

If the fetus is not developed enough to make the mother impure the next son is a firstborn.  In Tractate Niddah (Niddah 21a) this distinction is explained, and in Tractate Bekhorot the Sages describe which firstborn children are considered first for inheritance and which are first for the Kohen.  Some are for both and some are for one or the other.",

            "From the laws of the mitzvah:  The Sages said (Bekhorot 49a) that the mitzvah begins when the child is 30 days old, for at that point he is no longer considered a potential stillborn, as it is written, \"and his redemption is from the thirtieth day forward\" (Num 18:16).  This mitzah is the responsibility of the father (Kiddushin 29a).  If the father refused to redeem him, the mitzvah devolves upon the son, who then must redeem himself when he becomes an adult.  The amount of the redemption is five Selah, whether it be in cash or commodities (though property rights are insufficient, i.e. land and slaves are not satisfactory).  The five Selah may be given to one Kohen or to several Kohanim, and the obligation is to give it to a male Kohen as the verse says 'Aharon and his sons' in the context of redeeming the firstborn.  If the Kohen wishes to return the redemption money after it is given he may do so, so long as the money is not given with this stipulation in mind.  If he did give the money with this condition the son is not redeemed until he gives it as a full gift.  If he specified that the money was given with the condition that it be returned, and the Kohen was appeased by the child is redeemed.", 
            "Our Sages also taught us that the common ceremony is as follows:   The would bring a cup of wine and a myrtle branch to the home of the father of the baby or some other place, and the Kohen who was chosen by the father to receive the redeption first blesses over the wine and the myrtle and then recites another blessing - \"Blessed are You, our Lord, King of the World, who sanctified the fetus in his mother's womb, and at 40 days individuated his limbs into 248 types, and then breathed in the spirit of life, as it is written, 'and He breathed in his nostrils ...' (Gen. 2:7).  He clothed him with flesh and skin, and surrounded him with bones and ligaments, as it written, He clothed me  with flesh and skin and covered me with bones and ligaments' (Job 10:11).  He appointed food and drink for him, honey and milk to bring him joy, and appointed to angels to protect him in his mother's womb, as it is written, 'with life and kindness ..' (Job 10:12).  His mother says, 'this is my firstborn, with which HaShem opened the walls of my abdomen' and his father says, 'this is my firstborn and I am commanded to redeem him, as it is written, \"and all the first born of your sons you shall redeem\" (Ex 13:13)'.  May it be Your Will that as You have allowed this father to merit to redeem this child, may he also merit to [bring him] to Torah, marriage, and good deeds.  Blessed are You HaShem, who sanctified the first born of Israel to be redeemed.\"  The father then makes two blessings, 'on the redemption of the first born\" and \"You have allowed us to live\".  He then gives the specified redemption to the Kohen, the five Selah as established in the Torah.  This is equal to 60 argintz of pure silver in our land.  After the redemption, the Kohen recited the aforementioned three blessings.", 
            "Ramban also wote that when the father gives the money to the Kohen he should first place the child in the Kohen's hand, and the Kohen should say, \"Which to do value more highly, you son or or these five Selah?\"  The father responds that he prefers his son.  The Kohen then takes the money and passes them over the head of the son and says, \"this is in the place of this, traded for this, rendered no longer sacred through this.  This is for the Kohen and this child should grown to life and Torah and fear of heaven.  May it be His will that as this one has come to be redeemed may he also attain Torah, marriage and good deeds, and let us say Amen.\"  The Kohen then places his hands on son on blesses him as he knows how, such as \"may HaShem guard you ...\" or \"With long days and years of life ...\" or \"may HaShem protect you from all evil and guard your soul.\"  He then dismisses him to pursue whatever his pursuits may be.  More details are explained in Tractate Bekhorot.", 
            "This mitvah always applies to male Israelites, as we have in our tradition that only a man who could potentially have redeemed himself must redeem his, but a women is outside of the whole notion of redemption.  The mitzvah also excludes Koahnim and Levites from a rational argument, (Bekhorot 4a), if they could exempt Israelites in the desert they should certainly exempt themselves.  the Sages also said that even a son of an Israelite whose mother is a Kohenet or Leviah is exempt (Bekhorot 47a), as the matter is dependant upon the mother's womb.  One who did not redeem his son at the proper time, that is after 30 days, if he dies before he is redeemed he has failed to fulfill this mitzvah, and woe unto him for he carries his sin with his soul.  Even though there is no specified tiome for this mitzvah, as any time after 30 days have elapsed is appropriate, still the wise of heart will pursue mitzvot and perform the mitzvah at the first available moment.  It seems that the father's obligation remains even after the son matures, as the verse says, \"And all the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem\" (Ex. 13:17), implying that the mitzvah is principally the father's, and so it seems from Kiddushin."

On this the verse says, \"However, the first born of your ox, sheep, or goat should not be redeemed.  They are sacred.\" (Num. 18:17)  The Torah specified the three types of kosher cattle that are subject to this command, as the seven varieties of wild animal are not included, as I explained in Parashat Bo.

Since it stands to be offered as a sacrifice the Kohen has not right to sell it.  Today (when there is no Temple), since it is destined to be eaten the Kohen may sell it, even though it is unblemished, to a kohen or an Israelite.  Obviously, Maimonides meant that it will be eaten when it gets a blemish.  A blemished first born can be sold by the Kohen at any time, whether the Temple is standing or not, whether it is alive or already slaughtered, to any person, even a non-Jew, as it is completely un-sacred.

If one brought a first born animal from the Diaspora it may not be offered as a sacrifice, as it is completely unsacred.  Everyone is obligated in this mitzvah, Kohanim, Levites, and Israelites, as it says, \"Any firstborn that is born.\" (Deut 15:19)  Even though the Kohanim and Levites are exempt from redeeming the firstborn sons and donkeys, as we have written elsewhere, they are obligated in this.  One who transgressed redeemed his forstborn kosher cattle, even though it is not effective and the animal remains sacred, has violated a negative commandment.

Still, within that tribe one group was selected to be the head officer for the rest for all eternity, and they are the most sacred of all the Levites who minister before HaShem permanently.  The rest of the tribe serves to assist, as the verse says, \"And HaShem spoke to Aharon saying, 'You, your sons, and your patriarchal lineage shall bear the burden of the Temple.'\"  That is, while the entire tribe must guard the Temple, this family would carry the burden of the priesthood, the primary service.  The verse continues, \"Also your brthren, the tribe of Levi, of your father, shall be brought close with you and accompany you and serve you.\"  This implies that you are primary, and not them.  It also says elsewhere, \"The levites are given to Aharon and sons.  They are truly given.\" (Num. 3:9)  Since the Kohanim are the primary doers in the service of HaShem they receive 24 gifts that are described in the verse and enumerated by the Sages (Chullin 133b): ten in the Temple, four in Jerusalem, and ten elsewhere.  The rest of the tribe that is chosen to assist Aharon is also given a life of luxury without toil through the produce tithes that they receive from all Israel.  To encourage them to contemplate that all of their portion, and that of their brethren, is due to their service of HaShem, they are commanded to give a tenth of all they receive from Israel to the 'greater ministers'.  This will remind them that someone is above them, and One is above all of them, He Who Guards All.  This also has a dignifying effect for the Levites as it allows them to participate int he mitzvah of giving tithes.

If he [illegitimately] tithed the sheaths, he includes the straw in his calculation, and then he must thresh and winnow and give it all.  They also said (Mishnah, Terumot 11:8) that only volumes greater than 1/64 of a log must be given to the Kohen.  If the volume is less than this he need not be bothered to give it to the Kohen, but he should simply burn it.  They also said (Mishnah, Bikkurim 2:5) that this tithe need not be taken from proximate material, as it is written, \"From all the tithes that you gift\" (Num. 18:28), that is, even if you have a tithe in one country and another in another country, you may take one gift form all of them.

Even though I have attempted to write simple reasons for the other mitzvot, as the purpose of this work is to instruct my son and his friends, on this mitzvah I am unable and wary of saying anything at all.  I have seen that the Sages spoke at length on the complexity and mysteriousness of this mitzvah to the point that they said that King Solomon, who who through his great wisdom was able to understand all the mitzvot, wrote about this, “I have sought wisdom, but it is far from me.” (Ecc. 7:23)  They also wrote in the Midrash: Rabbi Yosi B'rebbi Chanina said, “HaShem said to Moshe, 'To you I will explain this mitzvah, but not to others.'”  There are many other similar statements.

On this point the non-Jews have a claim against Israel, as they believe that it is offered to the demons, as is their practice today.   Indeed many medicinal herbs, from the Lebanon cedar to the common hyssop weed operate in opposite ways.  They heat the cold and cool the hot.  If we understood the nature of the body and spirit and the causes of illness and health we would perhaps also understand how the heifer can sicken the soul and render impure those who are involved in burning it, and how it is that when it is ashes it heals the sickness of impurity.

The need for it to be “perfect” is that it be perfectly red, and two black or white hairs disqualify it.

It was purchased with money from the general collection.  A heifer that became blemished can be redeemed and made de-consecrated.  They also taught that the one who burns the heifer becomes impure, as does the one who assists in the process, such as the person who turns over the carcass, or adds firewood, or blows the flame or stokes the coals, but the person who lights the fire, or arranges the wood is pure, as is anyone who deals with the ashes.

Each day they would sprinkle him with existing ashes, and this would be done by someone who had never experienced impurity in his life, as the sprinkler must be pure.  You might wonder why they could not have simply used someone who had been impure and subsequently purified.  This would not have been adequate, as there was the possibility that the person may have not been purified by a pure person.  Also, any vessels that wee filled to be poured on the Kohen who would burn the heifer were all stone, so that they are not susceptible to impurity.",

            "Because of this the Sages taught (Bava Batra 126b) that if the estate holder says that he wishes to disinherit his son or daughter, or that his daughter should inherit instead of his son, or anything similar, his words are irrelevant, as he has no power to change the Word of HaShem concerning inheritance.  Even though we said that a person owns his property for all purposes, to give whatever he wishes to whomever he wishes, even to destroy his property, this is an exception, as this statement counter-indicates the words of HaShem and His laws.  HaShem determined which heir precedes, and a person has no power to change that.  This is reflected in the Mishnah (Bava Batra 130a), \"One who says, “So-and-so, who is my firstborn, shall not receive a double portion,\" [or] “So-and-so, my son, shall not inherit with his brothers,\" has said nothing, for he has stipulated against what is written in the Torah. Rabbi Yohanan ben Baroka says: If he refers to one who is qualified to inherit from him, his words are valid, but if he refers to one who is not qualified to inherit from him, his words his words are not valid.”\"  This means that if he selected on son among his sons daughter among his daughters to inherit the entire estate, it stands.  This is derived in the Talmud from the verse, \"And on the say that he gives his inheritance to his sons\" (Deut. 21:16), which implies that the Torah gav the father permission to select among his potential heirs.  The law is decided according to the view of Rabbi Yochanan for most cases, but not for the first born; the father has no power to disinherit the firstborn in this way.", 
            "They also said (Bava Bata 126b) that if a perosn divides his property and gives a large portion to one and a small portion to another, or is he gives a standard portion to the first-born, his words are valid.  If he did so using the term 'inheritance' it is not valid.  If at any point he referred to it as a gift, his words are valid.  It seems that even though his words are invalid when he uses the term inheritance, and no relevant action will be taken (as is explicit in the Mishna), through this command he has negated the positive commandment associated with inheritance, for he has trangressed the command of the king.  Also, if after he dies the court affirms his statements, they have similarly negated this mitzvah, in addition to transgressing the negative commandment of perverting justice.  It seems from Rambam that the thrust of this mitzvah is really for the court that will judge these matters, as he wrote, \"It is commanded to judge matters of inheritance\" and he explains on the mitzvah of annulling vows.", 
            "From the root of the mitzvah: A person should consider that the world is controlled by an authority who is concerned for His creations, and it is His will that apportions to each person the possessions that he attains in this world.  The gifts that He gives were intended to stay with those who received them, were it not for the Original Sin that brought death to the world.  Yet the death of an individual body should not end the gifts that HaShem had given, but they should propogate on their own to the body that extends from this one, i.e. a son or daughter.  If some misfortune causes him to die without children, it is proper for the blessing of HaShem to revert to some other relative, as this blessing was either due to his own merit or that of his forebearers, or perhaps his close relatives taught him some skill that caused him to amass wealth.  Therefore when he dies without children it is reasonable for his relatives who assisted him in this merit to precede all other people.", 
            "From the laws of the mitzvah:  The Sages taught the order of inheritance in the Mishna (Bava Batra 115a), that a son precedes a daughter, and all offspring of a son precede a daughter, daughter before brothers, and all offspring of a daughter before brothers.  Brothers and sisters (if there are no borhters) precede uncles, and uncles and aunts (if there are no uncles) precede other relatives.  The general rule is that the offspring of any heir precedes the next relation, and the father always precedes his offspring, and in this way we continue until the beginning of the lineage.  Therefore, there is not anyone in Israel who was no heir.", 
            "The Sages also taught (Bava Batra 108a) that a mother does not bequeath her property to her children, and maternal aunts do not inherit from each-other, as maternal family is not called family.  A mamzer does inherit like other sons, and even a mazer's child that become an apostate inherits, but a child of a maid-servant or non-Jewess does  not inherit as he his not the father's son for any purpose.  The Sages established that a wife would inherit her husband's property if they are fully married, and they linked this to a verse in the Torah.", 
            "Maimoniders wrote that part if these laws id that the first-born receives a double portion.  This means that if there are two brothers, we divide the property into three parts and the first born takes two.  If there are three brothers we divide it into four parts and the first-born takes two, and so forth.  The first-born only takes double in properties that are held by the father, that is, that were extant in the father's possession in his lifetime.  This is to exclude unpaid debts, as it is written, \"Of all that is found with him.\" (Deut. 21:17)  How does this work?  If one of the individuals from whom the father could inherit dies after the father, the first-born does not take double from that inheritance.  Or if the father had a debtor that owed him money, even if it was recorded in a contract, or if he has a merchant ship [raising revenue], the first-born does not take double, as these are not \"found with the father.\"  For the same reason the first-born does not take double of the profits that come from the properties, such as a field yielding grain, or trees bearing fruit, as these were not extant when the father was alive.  If, however, a small tree grew larger without direct input after the father's death, the first-born does take double of the value of the growth; this is considered extant as it is unchanged in form.", 
            "The father is trusted to identify which son is first-born (Kiddushin 74a), or to claim paternity (or non-paternity) of any child.  The Torah gave him this authority in the verse, \"He shall recognize his first born.\"  The Sages derived (Bava Batra 127b) from this that he can identify him for others, even if someone claims that he is Reuven's son, if Reuven denies it the son will not inherit.  Maimonides wrote, \"It seems to me that even if there are grandsons, such that the father is not believed for the purposes of family relationships  to render them mamzerim, he can still say that they will not inherit.", 
            "The Sages also taught (Bava Batra 129b) that if a person says to another, \"My property is yours and the remainder will be for another,\" if the first is eligible to inherit the latter has not claim.  Since the first gained rights to the property and is a legitimate heir, no further accounting of inheritance is needed.  According to the best explanations we learned that even if he says that this will take effect retroactively, that is, \"My property is yours, and after you so-and-so will have it from now,\" the latter still has no claim as the first is a legitimate heir.  If the first is not an heir and he formulates this retroactively, the latter has rights to the property itself, and the first one receives the income in his lifetime.  If he did not formulate it retroactively the latter only receives what is left from the first.  If the first sells the property the latter can never retrieve it from the purchaser, as they stay in the possession of the first for his entire life for all purposes, and he can sell or give them to anyone he chooses.  They are so fully in the possession of the first that if the initial formualtion was \"my property is yours, and then X and then Y\" then if X dies in the lifetime in the life of the first the Sages taught (Bava Batra 129b) that his heirs receive the property, as the original ceder of the property only stipulated that they would trnasfer from the first to X and then to Y, and since this is impossible, Y has no claim, and the only claimants are the heirs of the first.", 
            "10", 
            "11", 
            "The mitzvah always applies to both men and women.  One who transgressed and ordered inheritance to take place in some other order, whether he is well or on his death bed, has negated this positive commandment, provided that used the term 'inheritance' as I have said.  This is true even though his orders are inactionable.  "

            "From the root of the mitzvah: Since people are physical, they are necessarily drawn after their desires for the nature of all physical things is to seek pleasure and to enjoy it, just as a horse or a donkey who understand nothing.  The soul that the Lord has given to us prevents us, to its ability, from sin. But as it resides here on earth, far removed from the boundaries of heaven, it is often unsuccessful, and the physical will often defeat it.  It therefore needs many guards to protect it from its malevolent neighbor, lest it rise up and kill it, as it is in its environs and under its control.  HaShem wanted to help us, the holy nation, and He commanded us to set up mighty guards around [the soul], and they are: the command to perpetually study Torah day and night, and to wear fringes on the four corners of our garments, and a mezuzah on our doorpost, and the tefillin on our arm and head.  All of this is to remind us to avoid the crimes that we can commit with our hands and to not stray after our eyes or the passions of our hearts.  Therefore, the Sages said (Zevachim 19a) that the Kohanim and Levites were exempt from these things when they performed the Temple service.   As the foundation of the tefillin is as we have said, we are also instructed (Menachot 36b) to not allow our thoughts to wander from them.  Now, my son, see how much power our bodies have over our souls, for despite all this we sometimes do 'break the fence'.  May the Lord in His mercy aid us and protect us, Amen."

            "By way of this idea that I have enlightened you, my son, about, I will interpret for you a certain aggada in Bava Metzia 59b, regarding the story of Rabbi Eliezer the Great and the \"oven of Achnai\", which bewilders all who hear it. They said there, \"R. Natan met the prophet Elijah and said to him, 'What did the Holy One Blessed be He do in that hour?' He said to him: He smiled and said, 'My sons have defeated Me...'\" - meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, was happy that His sons walked in the way of the Torah and its commandments, to incline after the majority rule. And that which is says, \"My sons have defeated Me\", God-forbid that there is any defeat before Him, blessed be He, but the explanation is about this idea, that in the debate of Rabbi Eliezer with his colleagues, Rabbi Eliezer had the right of it, and the Bat Kol had decided like him. Even though the truth was with him because of his better explication over his colleagues who could not fathom his mind, and they did not concede to him even after the Bat Kol, and they brought a proof from the law set in the Torah that commands us to always go after the majority rule, whether they say the truth or whether they are mistaken. About this was the response of the Creator, blessed be He, \"My sons have defeated Me.\" Meaning, after they turned away from the true path, for Rabbi Eliezer had surmised the truth, and they came upon him from the power of the Torah commandments that commanded them to always listen to the majority, if so then, anyway one looks at it, this time one must concede to them as they said, [though] it lacks truth, for it is as if the \"Master of Truth\" had been defeated."
