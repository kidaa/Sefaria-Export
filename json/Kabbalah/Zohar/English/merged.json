                "﻿R. Hiya said: It is written, God maketh the earth by his strength (Jer. X, 12). He who maketh the earth is the Holy One, blessed be He, above; by his strength means by the Zaddik; he establishes the universe, this is the earth beneath; by his wisdom,, refers to Zedek (justice). Also it is written, makes the earth, and not made, because God constantly regulates the earth and its activities through the agency of His strength, as just explained...  R. Isaac said: It is written, By the word of the Lord the heavens were made and by the breath of his mouth all their hosts. The heavens mentioned here are the lower heavens, which were made by the word of the upper heavens, through the spirit which sent forth a voice until it reached that stream which issues and flows perennially. By all their hosts is meant the lower world, which exists through that breath, which is male. A similar lesson is derived from the verse, Who watereth the mountains from his upper chambers, the earth is full of the fruit of thy works (Ps. CIV, 13). The upper chambers we have already explained, and the term can be further illustrated by the verse, Who lays the beams of his upper chambers in the waters. The expression the fruit of thy works alludes to that stream which ever flows and issues forth; hence it is written, Yielding fruit whose seed is in it, as explained.\n"
