And it bothered them that they were no longer trusted to remove the firstborns from the Kohanim and give it all up to Moshe's family alone. All of this occurred during the sin of the Golden Calf for then they were seen as complete when they surpassed the firstborns who were worshiping since they were then the priests. And the Leviim killed the worshipers of the Calf. And there is here a question whose answer is in Parshas Vayeilech."
