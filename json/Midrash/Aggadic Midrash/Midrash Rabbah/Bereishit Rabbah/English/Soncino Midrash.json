            "Rabbi Nahman said in Rabbi Samuel's name: 'Behold, it was good' refers to the Good Desire; 'And behold, it was very good' refers to the Evil Desire. (It only says 'very good' after man was created with both the good and bad inclinations, in all other cases it only says 'and God saw that it was good') Can then the Evil Desire be very good? That would be extraordinary! But without the Evil Desire, however, no man would build a house, take a wife and beget children; and thus said Solomon: 'Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man's rivalry with his neighbour.' (Ecclesiastes 4:4)."

            "And Abram was ninety years old and nine, etc. (xvn, i). It is written, I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness , / saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at her first season (Hos. ix, 10). R. Judan said: At first the fruit of a fig-tree is gathered one by one, then two by- two, then three by three, until eventually they are gathered in baskets and with shovels. 1 Even so, at the beginning, Abraham was one (Ezek. xxxiii, 24); then there were Abraham and Isaac; then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Until eventually, And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, etc. (Ex. vn, 1). R. Judan said: Just as a fig contains nothing inedible save its stalk, and with its removal even this defect ceases, so did God say to Abraham: 'There is nought unworthy in thee save thy foreskin: remove it and the blemish ceases': hence, Walk before me, and be thou whole. ", 
            "And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, etc. It is written, To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven (Eccl. in, 1). There was a season when circumcision should be given to Abraham viz. In the self same day was Abraham circumcised (Gen. xvii, 26); there was a season when his descendants were to neglect it, viz. in the wilderness, as it is written, For all the people that came out were circum- cised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, had not been circumcised (Josh, v, 5). Why should he not have circumcised himself at the age of forty-eight, when he recognised his Creator ? In order not to discourage proselytes. Then why not be circum- cised at the age of eighty-five, when [God] spoke with him between the pieces? In order that Isaac might issue from a holy source. Then let him be circumcised at the age of eighty-six, when Ishmael was born? Said R. Simeon b. Lakish : [God said] : ' I will set up a cinnamon tree in the world: just as the cinnamon tree yields fruit as long as you manure and hoe around it, so [shall Abraham be] even when his blood runs sluggishly and his passions and desires have ceased/ ",

            "R. Ishmael and R. Akiba [reasoned as follows]. R. Ishmael said: Abraham was a High Priest, as it says, The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent : Thou art a priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek (Ps. ex, 4). 1 Again, it is said, And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your 'orlah (Gen. xvn, 11). If he circumcised himself at the ear, he would be unfit to offer sacrifices ; if at the mouth, he would be unfit to offer; at the heart, he would be unfit to offer. 2 Hence, where could he perform circumcision and yet be fit to offer ? Nowhere else than at the 'orlah of the body [the foreskin]. R. Akiba said: There are four kinds of 'orlah. Thus, 'orlah is used in connection with the ear, viz. Behold, their ear is 'orlah — E.V. 'dull' (Jer. vi, 10); the mouth, Behold, I am 'aral [E.V. 'uncircumcised']* of lips (Ex. vi, 30); the heart: For all the house of Israel are 'arle [E.V. 'uncircumcised'] in the heart (Jer. ix, 25). Now, he was ordered, Walk before me, and be thou whole. If he circumcised himself at the ear, he would not be whole; at the mouth, he would not be whole; at the heart, he would not be whole. Where could he circumcise himself and yet be WHOLE? Nowhere else than at the 'orlah of the body.  Nakdah said : It is written, And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male (Gen. xvn, 12). Now if he is circumcised at the ear, he cannot hear; at the mouth, he cannot speak; at the heart, he cannot think. 4 Where then could he be circumcised and yet be able to think? Only at the 'orlah of the body. R. Tanhuma observed : This argument of Nakdah is logical.  And the uncircumcised male (xvii, 14). Is there then an uncircumcised female? The meaning, however, is that we must perform circumcision on the member which marks the distinction between male and female. "
