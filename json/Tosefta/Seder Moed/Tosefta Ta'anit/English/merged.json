            "We ask for the rains until Nissan is over, as it says, \"And rain will fall for you, the earlier and latter rains during the first [month] (Yoel 2);\" [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say,\"Earlier rains [fall in] Marcheshvan, and latter rains [fall on] the first of Nissan (and so these dates are the timetable for prayers for rain). Rabbi Meir said to them, \"Knowing that a tree makes fruit for twelve [months], and produce [grows] for six months; what have we found with trees, as it says [about it], \"By its month (meaning halfway through the month), it will bear (Yechezkel 47),\" so too produce, at its fifteenth day [its season ends]. Haven't you learnt, that earlier and latter rains [fall throughout] Nissan.", 
            "From when do we start asking for rains? From when the time of the rains comes. If it was a lacking year (meaning, a year with 353 days as opposed to 354), we give it its lack (the extra day it should have had). If not, it goes according to its set schedule: [All of this goes by] the words of Rabbi [Yehudah haNasi]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says, \"Actually, they go according to their set schedule [all the time].\" If it was a leap year, we give it its extra. ", 
            "What is considered the first rain (heb. R'viah)? [Rabbi Meir says, \"An early one (lit. a firstborn) [falls] by the third [of Marcheshvan]; a middle one [falls] by the seventh; [and] a late one (lit. a dark one) [falls] by the seventeenth.\" Rabbi Yehudah says, \"An early one [falls] by the seventh; a middle one [falls] by the seventeenth; [and] a late one [falls] by the twenty-third.\" Rabbi Yose says, An early one [falls] by the seventeenth; a middle one [falls] by the twenty-third; [and] a late one [falls] by Rosh Chodesh Kislev.\"] And so, Rabbi Yose would say, \"The individuals do not fast until Rosh Chodesh Kislev.\""
