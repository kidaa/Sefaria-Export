            "[If] one deposited [for safekeeping] an animal or vessels with his neighbor and they were stolen or lost, if he paid but did not want to swear [the prescribed oath], because they [the sages] said that an unpaid guardian must swear and be exempt [from liability, and if afterward] the thief is found, he must pay double. [If the thief] butchered and sold the object, he must pay four or fivefold. To whom does he pay? To him who [kept] the deposit is with him. [If the guardian] swore the [prescribed oath] and did not want to pay, and [afterward] the thief is found, he must pay double. [If the thief] butchered and sold the object, he must pay four or fivefold. To whom does he pay? To the owner of the deposit.", 
            "If one rented a cow from his neighbor, and loans it to another, and the cow dies naturally; the one who rented [the cow] should swear that it died naturally, and the borrower should pay the to the renter. Rabbi Yosei said: How shall he do business with his neighbor's cow? Rather, the cow [or its value] must be returned to the owners.", 
            "If one said to two [persons]: \"I have robbed one of you of a <i>maneh</i>, but I do not know from which of you;\" or [said]: \"The father of one of you deposited a <i>maneh</i> with me, but I do not know which,\" he must give a <i>maneh</i> to one and a <i>maneh</i> to the other, because he himself admitted it.", 
            "If two [people] deposited money with one, one has deposited a <i>maneh</i> and the other two hundred <i>zuz</i>, [and afterwards] one says: \"The two hundred <i>zuz</i> are mine,\" and the other one says: \"The two hundred <i>zuz</i> are mine,\" [the guardian] shall give a <i>maneh</i> to one and a <i>maneh</i> to the other, and the balance shall be put aside until Eliyahu comes. Rabbi Yosei said: If so, what did the deceiver lose? Rather, everything shall be put aside until Eliyahu comes.", 
            "This [is the same in a case of] two vessels, the value of one is a <i>maneh</i>, and the value of the other is thousand <i>zuz</i>. One says: \"The [more] valuable is mine,\" and the other one says: \"The [more] valuable is mine.\" He shall give the small [vessel] to one of them, and from the large [vessel], he shall give the value of the small [vessel] to the other, and the balance shall be put aside until Eliyahu comes. Rabbi Yosei said: \"If so, what did the deceiver lose? Rather, everything shall be put aside until Eliyahu comes.", 
            "The one who deposits fruit with his neighbor, even if they are destroyed, the guardian must not touch them. Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says: He should sell them under the supervision of the court because it is like one who restores a lost object to its owners.", 
            "The one who deposits fruit with his neighbor, he may deduct losses as follows: for wheat and rice, nine half-<i>kabim</i> to one <i>kor</i>; for barley and millet, nine-<i>kabim</i> to one <i>kor</i>; and for spelt and linseed, three <i>se'im</i> to one <i>kor</i>. Everything is according to the measure, [and] everything is according to the [length] of time. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri said: What do the mice care? Don't they eat [the same amount] whether from a lot or a little? Rather, he may only deduct a decrease of only one <i>kor</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says: If there was a large quantity, he may not deduct decreases, because [some] is left behind.", 
            "[The guardian] may deduct one-sixth for wine; Rabbi Yehuda says: \"One-fifth only.\" One may deduct three <i>logim</i> of oil from one hundred [<i>logim</i>]: a <i>log</i> and one-half for yeast, and a <i>log</i> and one-half [for the] absorption. If it was purified oil [stored], one cannot deduct [any] yeast; if the vessels were old, he cannot deduct [for] absorption. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even if the one who sells purified oil to his neighbor all the days of the year. [The purchaser] accepts a [loss of] <i>log</i> and one-half of yeast from one hundred [<i>logim</i> of oil.]", 
            "The one deposits a cask with his neighbor, and the owners do not assign a place [for it] and he moved it and it broke. If it was broken [while] it was in his hand [and it was] for his own need, he is liable; but [if it was] for the need of [the cask], he is exempt. If it broke, from when he placed it, either for his own need or for its need, he is exempt. [If] the owners assigned a place [for it] and he moved it and it broke, whether [it was] in his hand or from when he placed it, [if the move] was for his own need, he is liable, if it was for its need, he is exempt.", 
            "The one who deposited coins with his neighbor, and he tied them up [in a package] and carried it over his shoulder, or he entrusts them to his minor son or daughter, and locked it up before them [in a way] that was not satisfactory, he is liable, because he did not guard [them] in the manner of guardians, [however] if he did guard [them] in the manner of guardians, he is exempt.", 
            "[If] one deposited coins with a money-changer, if they were tied up, he may not use them, therefore if they were lost, he is not responsible for them; if they were loose, he may use them, therefore if they were lost, he is responsible for them. [If they were deposited] with a private person, he may not use them whether tied up or loose, therefore if they were lost, he is not responsible for them. A storekeeper is like a private person; these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: A storekeeper is like a money-changer.", 
            "The one who misuses the deposited [money], Beit Shammai says: He should be lashed for [any] loss and [any] increase;  Beit Hillel says: [He must pay the value from] the time it was taken. Rabbi Akiva says: [He must pay the value from] the time it was demanded. The one who considers misusing the deposit, the Beit Shamai says: He is liable; and the Beit Hillel says: He is not liable until he misuses it; as the Torah states, (Exodus 22:10): \"that he has not stretched forth his hand against the property belonging to his neighbor\"; How? If he bent down the cask, and took a quarter [of a <i>log</i>] from it, and it was broken, he must pay only for the quarter; if he lifted up the cask and took a quarter from it, and it was broken, he must pay the entire value [of the cask]."

            "A house and upper story belonging to two [separate] individuals that collapsed, the two of them divide the wood, stones, and mortar. And they look [at] which stones were likely to be broken. If one of them recognized some of his stones, he may take them and they are counted toward his portion.", 
            "A house and upper story belonging to two [separate] individuals: [if the floor of] the upper story deteriorated, and the landlord does not wish to fix [it], the owner of the upper story goes down and lives below until he fixes the upper story for him. Rabbi Yose says: The one who is below gives the ceiling, and the upper one [gives] the pavement.", 
            "A house and upper story belongs to two [separate] individuals, and both collapsed: if the owner of the upper story told the landlord to build [the lower level], and he did not want to build, the owner of the upper story builds the house and lives within it, until he pays him his expenses. Rabbi Yehudah says: then this one was living in [the property] belonging to his fellow, [and] he needs to pay him rent! Rather, if the owner of the upper story builds the house, the upper story, and the ceiling, he may dwell in the house until he pays him his expenses.", 
            "And this is also the case with the house of an olive-press, which is built into the rock and there is a single garden above it and it collapses: the owner of the garden goes down and sows below, until [the owner of the olive-press] makes the arches of his olive-press. [If] a wall or a tree fell into the public domain and caused damage, he is exempt from paying. If they had given him a set amount of time to trim the tree or to tear down the wall, and they fell within the time, he is exempt. After that time, he is liable.", 
            "[If] one's wall was adjacent to his fellow's garden and it fell, and he said to him, \"Remove your stones,\" and he said to him: \"They have come to you,\" they do not listen to him. [If], once he has accepted it upon himself, he said to him: \"Here are your expenditures, and I will take what is mine,\" they do not listen to him. [If] one hires a worker to work with him on straw or stubble, and he said to him, \"Pay me my wages,\" and he said to him: \"Take what you made as your wage,\" they do not listen to him. [If,] once he has accepted it upon himself, he said to him, \"Here are your wages and I will take what is mine,\" they do not listen to him. [If] one removes his manure into the public domain, the one who removes it [from there] has removed [it], and one who has spread out the manure has spread it out. Clay may not be soaked in the public domain, nor may bricks be baked. But clay may be kneaded in the public domain, though bricks may not. [If] one builds from the public domain, the one who brings stones may bring, and the one who builds may build, and if he caused damage, he pays what he damaged. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: He may even prepare his labor there thirty days before.", 
            "Two gardens are one on top of the other, with vegetables [growing] between them. Rabbi Meir says they petain to the upper, and Rabbi Yehudah says they pertain to the lower owner. Rabbi Meir said, \"If the [owner of] the upper would want to take his soil, there would not be vegetables there.\" Rabbi Yehudah said, \"If the [owner of] the lower would want to fill his garden, there would be no vegetables there.\" Rabbi Meir said: \"Since each of them is able to hold the other one back, we identify from where the vegetable is sustained from.\" Rabbi Shimon said: \"Anything that the [owner of] the upper is able to reach out his hand and take, this is his, and the remainder belongs to [owner of] the lower.\""
