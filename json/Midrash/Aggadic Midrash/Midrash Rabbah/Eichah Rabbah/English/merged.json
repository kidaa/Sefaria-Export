            "\"How (eichah) does she dwell...\" (Lamentations 1:1): There are three who prophesied with the language of \"eichah\": Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah. Moses said, (Deuteronomy 1:12), \"How (eichah) will I carry alone...\". Isaiah said, (Isaiah 1:21) \"How (eichah) she has become a prostitute...\" Jeremiah said, (Lamentations 1:1) \"How (eichah) does she dwell...\" Said Rabbi Levi: It is compared to a noble woman who had three friends. One saw her in her tranquility, one saw her in her recklessness, and one saw her in her degenerateness. So did Moses see Israel in their honor, and in their tranquility, and he said, \"How will I carry their burden alone?\" Isaiah saw them in their recklessnes, and he said \"How she has become a prostitute...\" Jeremiah saw them in their degenerateness, and he said, \"How does she dwell...\" They asked Ben Azzai, and they said to him: Our teacher, homileticize something for us from from the Lamentation Scroll. He said to them: Israel was not exiled until they denied the unity of the world, and [denial of] circumcision that had been given [after] 20 generations, and of the 10 commandments, and of the 5 books of the Torah, the numbers in \"Eichah\" (Alef - Yud - Chaf - Heh = 1-10-20-5). Rabbi Levi said: Israel was not exiled until they denied the 36 [punishments] of spiritual extermination (karet) in the Torah, and the 10 commandments. From where? \"Eichah yashva badad\" (Eichah = 36, Badad = 10). Rabbi Berachia in the name of Rav Avdimi from Haifa: [This is compared] to a king who had a son. When [the son] does his father's will, he was dressed in clothes of fine wool. When he doesn't do the will of the [Omnipresent?], he is dressed in the clothes of the exiled (badad). So is Israel, whenever they do the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, it is written (Ezekiel 16:10) \"I clothed you in embroidered dress...\" Rabbi Sima: A cloak. The translation of Aquila: Embroidered garments. Whenever they don't do the will of the Holy one, blesses be He, they are dressed in the clothes of the exiled, which is what is written, \"How she dwells alone (badad).' Rabbi Nachman said in the name of Shmuel in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The Holy One, blessed be He, called to the ministering angels. He said to them: A king of flesh and blood, when one of his dies, and he becomes mournful, what is his way to do? They said to him: He hangs a sack on his entranceway. He said to them: So too Me, thus shall I do. Thus it is written: (Isaiah 50:3) \"I cloth the heavens in blackness, and I will place a sack as their covering.\" [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? They said to him: He extinguishes the lanterns. He said to them: Thus shall I do, as it is said, (Joel 2:10) \"The sun and the moon are darkened.\" [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? They said to him: He overturns the beds. He said to them: Thus shall I do, as it is written, (Daniel 7:9) \"till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit\". As if it's possible, they were upside down. [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? [They said:] He goes barefoot. [He said:] Thus shall I do, as it is written, (Nahum 1:3) \"The Lord's way is in the tempest and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet.\" [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? [They said:] He rips his cloak. [God said:] Thus shall I do, as it is written, (Lamentations 2:17) \"God has done what He planned, bitza emrato.\" Rabbi Yaaakov of Kfar Channan interpreted it: What is \"bitza emrato\"? It is \"He ripped His cloak\". [God asked:] What is the way of a king of flesh and blood to do? [They said:] He sits in silence. [God said:] Thus shall I do, as it is written, as it is written, (Lamentations 3:28) \"He shall sit alone and in silence.\" [God asked:] A mourning king of flesh and blood, what is his way to do? [They said:] He sits and cries. [God said:] Thus shall I do. As it is written, (Isaiah 22:12) \"And God, Lord of Hosts, called on that day, for weeping and lamenting and balding.\" ...........................................And Rabbi Nehemiah says: There is no expression of \"Eichah\" but rather an elegy. this is what you said (Genesis) the Lord called man and said to him, Eichah, Woe to such a state",

            "A certain person from Athens came to Jerusalem. He labored for three and a half years to learn the language of wisdom, and he did not learn it. After three and a half years, he bought a slave who was blind, saying, \"After three and a half years, and I have bought a blind slave! [I have accomplished very little here!]\" He [the slave-trader] said to him, \"By your life, he is wise in abundance, and he sees from far away!\" As they left the gate, he [the slave] said to him, \"Let us hurry to meet up with the group ahead of us.\" He said to him, \"Is there [truly] a group ahead of us?\" He said to him, \"Indeed. And in ahead of us is a camel that is blind in one eye. In its womb are two [camels], and it carries two flasks, one of wine and one of vinegar. It is four millin distance, and the camel-driver is a gentile.\" He said to him, \"A broken-knecked people! With one eye, from where do you know that it is blind in one eye?\" He said to him, \"I saw that one side of the way was grazed, and one was not grazed.\" \"And two in the womb, from where did you know that?\" He said to him, \"It kneeled, and I saw their places [by the traces in the sand].\" He said to him, \"From where did you know that it carried two flasks, one of wine and one of vinegar?\" He said to him, \"From the drops, for the wine was absorbed [by the sand], and the vinegar floated atop [the sand]. \"That the camel-driver was a gentile, from where did you know?\" \"He made water in the middle of the way, and a Jew would not make water in the middle of the way, but rather in one corner.\" \"And that it is a distance of four millin, from where did you know that?\" He said to him, \"Up to a distance of four millin, the camel's hoofprints [remain] visible, thereafter they are not visible [because the sand would cover it over].\""

            "The hands of merciful women cooked their children:  Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yossi:  The Holy One, Blessed be He said: They prevented me from acting in my world.  How?  One of [the women] had a loaf of bread, which was sufficient to feed her and her husband for one day.  However, her neighbor's son died, so she took that same loaf of bread, and used it to comfort [her neighbor].  The text praises them, saying it's as if they cooked their children for mitzvot.  Thus it is written \"the hands of merciful women cooked their children\".  And why [include this at all]? [To report] that \"they [the women stayed] pure to Him\""

            "\"Remember, God, what happened to us...\" (Lamentations 5:1) - Rabbi Yitzchak began: (Proverbs 30:31) \"The greyhound or the male goat...\" The way of the world is that when a person raises two greyhounds in his house, one big and one small, he puts the big one in front, [in case the big one is attacked,] a mercy on his expenses. Rabbi Berachia said: Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Master of the World, doesn't it say in your Torah, (Deuteronomy 25:17) 'Remember what Amalek did to you...'? He did it to us, but not to You? Didn't he destroy Your Temple? The Rabbanan said: Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, we are Yours and the nations of the world are Yours, why don't You have mercy on Your nation? \"And the king against whom there is no rising up\" (Proverbs 30:31): Rabbi Yitzchak said: Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, \"Forgetfulness is among us, but it is not among You, nor before You. Therefore, remember! (Psalms 137:7) \"Remember, God, the people of Edom on the day of Jerusalem; who said, \"Aru, Aru\", even to the foundation thereof.\" Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: [\"Aru, Aru\" means] \"Destroy, Destroy\". And Rabbi Levi said: [\"Aru, Aru\" means] \"Raze, Raze\". the one who says, \"Destroy, Destroy\" uses the verse (Jeremiah 51:58) \"Babylon's thick walls will be \"Ar'er tit'ar'er\" - \"totally demolished\"\". The one who said \"Raze, Raze\" uses the verse (Psalms 137:7) \"even the foundations thereof\", even to it's bottommost foundations. \"Look, see our shame\" (Lamentations 5:1) - Rabbi Yudan said: Looking is up close, seeing is from afar. \"Looking is up close\", as is written, (I Kings 19:6) \"And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake cooked on hot coals...\" \"Seeing is from afar\", as is written, (Genesis 22:4) \"And he saw the place from afar.\" Rabbi Pinchas said: Looking is from afar, as is written, (Psalms 80:14), \"Look from the heavens and see.\" Seeing is up close, as is written, (Genesis 32:26), \"And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh.\"", 
            "\"Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers...\"(Lamentations 5:2) - What kind of \"turning over\"? Like the turning over of Sodom. Jeremiah called it: \"Our inheritance.\" Isaiah called it: (Isaiah 64:10)\"Our holy and beautiful house.\" Asaf came and said: It is not \"our inheritance\", nor \"our holy and beautiful house\", but \"the nations invade what is Yours\". That is what is written: (Psalms 79:1) \"[A psalm of Asaf:] O God, the nations have invaded Your inheritance; they have defiled Your holy Temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.\"", 
            "\"We have become orphans, and fatherless...\" (Lamentations 5:3) - Rabbi Berachia said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: You weep and say before me, \"We have become orphans, and fatherless.\" By your lives, so will your redeemer that I will raise among you in Media, he will not have a father nor a mother. That's what is written: (Esther 2:7) \"He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter; for she had neither father nor mother.\"", 
            "\"We pay to drink our water...\" (Lamentations 5:4) - One time, enemies entered, took the bread, wine, oil, and water, came back and sold it to them. They said, \"Woe is to us, that we have fulfilled this verse: 'We pay to drink our water, our wood comes at a price.'\" (Lamentations 5:4)", 
            "\"Our pursuers are at our necks...\" (Lamentations 5:5) - Hadrian, may his bones be crushed, decreed and said: If we come and find a Jew with hair, we will take off his head. That's what is written, \"Our pursuers are at our necks.\" (Lamentations 5:5). Alternatively: \"Our pursuers are at our necks\", for we rebelled against our necks on this day of distress [and had thrown off the yoke of Torah]. \"We have toiled and have received no rest.\" (Lamentations 5:5) - Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed, commanded Nevuzaradan and said to him: \"The god of these people accept repentant ones, and his hand extends to receive those who return [to him]. Once you have captured them, we must not allow leave for them to pray, so they won't repent for their god to have mercy on them, and they will leave with blackened faces. Don't be easy on them.\" Once he captured them, when one would stand before him, he had him sentenced to be torn limb from limb. He tore him up in front of them. They went unwillingly without [needing] shackles. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Nevuzaradan is Arioch. Why was his name Arioch? Because he would roar at the captives like a lion, until they arrived at the Euphrates. When they reached the Euphrates, he said to the soldiers: Let them rest now, for from this point on their god won't return to them. That is what is written, (Psalms 137:1) \"By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat, we also cried.\" Until that point, we did not sit.", 
            "\"We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.\" (Lamentations 5:6) - What did the 10 tribes do? They sent oil to Egypt, brought in wheat and sent it to Assyria. For if enemies would come, they could help. That's what is written, (Hosea 12:1) \"They do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.\" [Additional version: That's what is written, (Lamentations 4:17) \"Our eyes failed, looking in vain for help...\"", 
            "\"Our fathers sinned and are no more... [it is we who have borne their iniquities]\" (Lamentations 5:7) - The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Through your [suffering] did they survive. Alternatively: [You] survive on My account.", 
            "\"Servants rule over us...\" (Lamentations 5:8) - This refers to Egypt. \"There is none to deliver us out of their hand.\" (Lamentations 5:8) - If it weren't for Moses. Alternatively: \"Servants rule over us...\" - This refers to the non-Jews. \"There is none to deliver us out of their hand\" - If it weren't for the Holy One, blessed be He.", 
            "\"We get our bread [in trade] for our spirit, [because of the sword in the wilderness].\" (Lamentations 5:9) - Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said: Originally, they were short of spirit, [and] distress from the non-Jews [only] shortened it [even more]. It is written about our ancestors: (Numbers 21:4) \"The people became short of spirit on the way...\" Daniel said: (Daniel 7:15) \"I was short of spirit.\" Isaiah said: (Isaiah 21:3) \"My loins are full of distress...\" Jeremiah said: \"We get bread [in trade] for our spirit.\" We, who find ourselves among the non-Jews, how much more so.", 
            "\"Our skin has become contracted (n-ch-m-r-u) like an oven('s heat), [because of the terrible famine]\" (Lamentations 5:10) - 2 amoraim: One said, \"[Their skin was] like those withered fruits [ch-m-r-y-a-t-a].\" And one said, \"Like an oven that has not been kindled as much as it needed to be [and have become blackened].\"", 
            "\"They ravished the women of Zion...\" (Lamentations 5:11) - Nevuzaradan [alt. Nevuchadnezzar] commanded his troops, saying to them, \"The god of these people hates promiscuity. Be careful not to touch another man's wife.\" Once the women heard that, they came and said to a man: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothes; only let us be called by your name [so that the troops won't touch us]. That's what is written, (Isaiah 4:1) \"And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by your name, to take away our shame.\" Except 3 were lazy and did not do this, and they were ravished. Therefore it says, (Lamentations 5:11) \"They ravished the women of Zion, virgins [b-t-l-t] in the cities of Judah\", written as \"three\" [b-t-l-t].", 
            "\"Princes were hanged up by their hand...\" (Lamentations 5:12) - An appointed officer would enter the city, and would take the best of the city and hang them. The elderly would come and bribe them, but they wouldn't accept it from them. Therefore it says, \"Princes were hanged up by their hand, the faces of elders were not honored.\" (Lamentations 5:12)",
