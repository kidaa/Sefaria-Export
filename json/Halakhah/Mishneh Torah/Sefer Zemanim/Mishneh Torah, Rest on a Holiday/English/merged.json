            "These six days on which scripture prohibited labor, namely the first and seventh days of Passover, the first and eighth days of Succot, the day of Shavuot, and first day of the seventh month (Rosh HaShanah), are called Holidays (<i>Yamim Tovim</i>). The degree of cessation of labor is equal in all of them, in that all labor is prohibited, excepting the one category of labor necessary for preparing food, as stated (Exodus 12:16): \"Except anything that shall be eaten by any person\" ",

And why did they prohibit this? It is a protective decree lest an individual leave the labors s/he could have done on the holiday eve for the holiday itself and find that his/her holiday is spent entirely on doing those very labors, and thus prevent the enjoyment of the holiday and leave no free time to eat.

            "These two festival days of the diaspora are two instances of holiness, and they are not like one day. Therefore, something that was <i>muktzeh</i> (set aside from use) on the first festival day, or that was born on the first, if he prepared it for the second, it is permitted. How so? An egg  that was laid on the first can be eaten on the second. A wild animal and a bird t hat were trapped on the first can be eaten on the second. Something connected to the ground that was uprooted on the first can be eaten on the second. And similarly, it is permitted to blue an eye on the second festival day, even though there is no sickness there. These words apply to the two festival days of the diaspora, bit the two days of New Year are one instance of holiness, and are considered like one day for all of these things, except only for the matter of the deceased. But, an egg that was laid on the first day of New Year is forbidden on the second, and similarly for all similar cases. If Sabbath was adjacent to a festival day, and an egg was laid on one of them, it is forbidden on the other, and similarly for all similar cases. And even if it was laid on the second day, it is not eaten on the Sabbath which is adjacent to it."

This is a rabbinic prohibition in order that [we don't transgress the even more serious Torah prohibition] and cook on chag for a weekday.  All the more so we don't cook on Shabbat for a weekday!  Therefore, [in order to make it possible to cook on a chag for the next day when it is Shabbat, the rabbis instituted the following permission if] we make a dish for Shabbat prior to the beginning of the chag which precedes it, then one may cook [the other dishes] on chag for Shabbat.

And we were not commanded to indulge in frivolity or foolishness, but rather in rejoicing that involves the service of the Creator of all existence. As it is said, \"Because you did not serve God, Your Lord, with happiness and a glad heart with an abundance of prosperity.\" (Deut. 28:47) This teaches us that service [of God] involves joy.
