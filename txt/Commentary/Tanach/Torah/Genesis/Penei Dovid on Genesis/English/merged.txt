Penei Dovid on Genesis

Chapter 1



Verse 1

It is possible to hint that the word <i>bereishit</i> is [made up of] the letters, "<i>beareshet yod</i> (by expression of ten)," which hints to (Avot 5:1), "with ten proclamations was the world created." And see what is written in <i>Petach Einayim</i> on the Mishna, "In ten proclamations," with God's help.  And I heard from an old God-fearing man that the words, <i>Bereishit bara</i> including the numerical equivalent of two [for these two words] is the numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One" (Deuteronomy 6:4). Up to here are his words, may His memory be a blessing for life in the world to come. And he gave me pleasure, since in the beginning of the Torah, there is found a hint to His unity, may He be blessed, and [also] all of the <i>kavannot</i> (mystical meditations) that are in the secret of the unification are hinted in these words, as it is stated in the Zohar and in the writings of Ari, of blessed and righteous memory - all of them are hinted in the beginning of our holy Torah. And after much time, I briefly chanced upon the book, <i>Tsvi Kodesh</i>, and I see at the end of page 2, that he wrote this <i>gematria</i>, and added that it is for this reason that our holy Rabbi (Rabbi Yehuda Hanassi) started the [corpus of the] Mishna with the commandment of reading the Shema, see there. 
"In the beginning (<i>resishit</i>)" in the Targum Yerushalmi is, "With wisdom did God create." And [its author's] words are simple according to the holy Zohar, since <i>resishit</i> is [the same] as wisdom (<i>hokhmah</i>), as it is written (Psalms 111:10), "The beginning (<i>resishit</i>) of wisdom is the fear of God." And it is written (Proverbs 3:19), "with wisdom did He establish the earth," [meaning] that wisdom  established the daughter (the earth/<i>malkhut</i>). And this is the [meaning of the] combination [of letters in the word,] <i>bereishit,</i> [which can also spell] <i>beit rosh</i> (house head) - <i>beit</i> hints to <i>malkhut</i> and <i>rosh</i> to wisdom (<i>hokhmah</i>); since the wisdom that is in '<i>abba</i>' established the daughter.<br>And it is possible to hint that [since] the end of the Torah (Dueteronomy 34:12) is "before the eyes of all of Israel;" it comes out that from its end, [the letter,] <i>lamed</i> and the [letter,] <i>bet</i> of  <i>bereshit,</i>, there is [a numerical equivalent of 32. And <i>reishit hokhmah</i> (see comment above) hints to the 32 paths of wisdom.<br>Alternatively, it is possible [to find a hint] in what was written by the Sages, of blessed memory, and which was cited by <i>Zera Berakh</i>, section 3 on this order, that King David, peace be upon him, held that wisdom is in the head and that is why he started Psalms with [the letter,] <i>alef</i>, and King Shlomo disagreed with him, [holding] that wisdom is in the heart, and hence he started the Book of Proverbs with a [letter,] <i>mem</i> to hint that wisdom is in the heart [which is in the middle of the body], just like <i>mem</i> is in the middle of the letters. And this is what King David, peace be upon him, said (Proverbs 23:15), "My son, if your heart is wise:" that if the main understanding is like you, that wisdom is in the heart and this is what is meant by "your heart is wise" - even though it is against my rationale - "my heart will rejoice;" since when a son is victorious over his father [in argumentation], [a father] rejoices, as He said [with apparent joy] (Baba Metzia 59b), "my children (which is also an acrostic for the Children of Israel) have defeated me, they have defeated me." This is the essence of the words of the rabbi [in] <i>Zera Barech</i>, section 3, see there at length.<br>[Based on the above], it is possible to hint that King David, peace be upon him, started Psalms with [the word,] <i>ashrei</i> which is the [same] letters [as] <i>roshi</i> (my head), as (according to him,) wisdom is in the head. If so, it is [further broken down as] <i>rosh yod</i>, as [the letter,] <i>yod</i> is a hint to thought, as Rashi says in Parshat Beshalach - <i>yod</i> is because, of thought - and it is the wisdom of the <i>yod</i> of the explicit name [of God]. And according to the rationale of Shlomo that wisdom is in the heart, it is for this reason that the Torah began with a [the letter,] <i>bet</i> and ended with the [letter,] <i>lamed</i>, which are [the letters of] heart (<i>lev</i>). And that which is left over from the letters of <i>bereshit</i> [after the <i>bet</i> is removed] hints to wisdom and that is [what is meant] by <i>lev reshit</i> ('the heart is first') - that wisdom is in the heart. <br>Alternatively, <i>bereshit</i> is a combination of [the letters of] <i>ashrei bat</i> (happy is the daughter) - which hints to the soul - as man is made up from the heavens and the earth and from all of the worlds; and by way of the Torah and its commandments, he binds the worlds and brings bounty to all of them. And with this is answered the inquiry of the early scholars (<i>Rishonim</i>) - that [since] the soul before its coming to this world eats from the bread of its Father and enjoys from the holy things of the heavens, so why was it created in the body and [brought] to this world, which is very dangerous [for it] - and go and see that with four [people] do we find that they died from the counsel of the snake [and not from their sins], only four, and [about this] it is written (Ecclesiastes 7:20), "there is no righteous person on the earth who does good and does not sin." And our master, of blessed memory, answered this inquiry by saying, "one who eats from his own (which he has earned), etc." And the Maggid praised this answer, as he said in the book, <i>Maggid Mesharim</i>, see there; and the commentators used this greatly, as is known. However, according to what has been said [above], it is fine; since with the coming of the soul to this world, the worlds connect - since the life force, spirit and soul (<i>neren</i>) attach [themselves] to the four [physical] elements and, through this, connect all of the worlds and bring bounty to all of them. And as my master, my elder, the rabbi explained - I brought his words in my little book, <i>Rosh David</i>, Parshat Mishpatim, see there - and it is clear, that [the order of things] is not sufficient except with the creation of man in this world. And behold, the holy elder expounded [the verse] (Exodus 21:7), "And if a man sells his daughter," to be about the soul. And this is hinted [to by] <i>ashrei bat</i> (happy is the daughter); meaning to say, the creation of man should not [seem] difficult as mentioned, since the 'daughter' is happy - happy is the soul that comes to this world. Since God has created man so that, through him, He connects the heavens and the earth and bounty comes to them all, and [so] He binds all of the worlds. And be exact and very much find the truth [to this].  <br>Alternatively, it is hinting - and first we will introduce [this] by what was written by the [author of] <i>Zera Berakh</i>, section 3 on this order of the day, page 2, side 4; that our Rabbis, of blessed memory, nicknamed a Torah scholar, 'daughter.' As they said that Torah [study] protects and saves from sin and from the evil impulse and [yet] they [also] said that the greater a person is than another, so too is his evil impulse greater than the other, and [so] a Torah scholar is in greater danger of sinning. And the commentaries explain that if a Torah scholar constantly sits in the 'tent' of Torah and does not go out, but rather reads and studies, such a Torah scholar is protected from sin; however if he properly fulfills the [concept] of 'Torah and the way of the world' (<i>Torah eem derekh erets</i>) and is involved in buying and selling, then the evil impulse bothers him and he is more in danger of sinning. And that is why a Torah scholar is compared to a daughter who always sits indoors, see there at length. And for this reason, the Torah opened [with] <i>bereshit</i>, which is a combination of [the letters of] <i>ashrei bat</i> (happy is the daughter), meaning to say, that the Torah requires the Torah scholar to be like a daughter - who should not go to and fro - and by this he will be saved from sin. And this is the hint: happy is the daughter - happy is the one who makes himself like a daughter; that he should be inside sitting in the tent. And with this, it becomes clear to me that which is written in Yoma 71, "'To you O men do I call' (Proverbs 8:4); Rabbi Berachia says, 'These are the Torah scholars that sit quietly like women and act strongly like men.'" And ostensibly, there needs to be a reason why he compares the Torah scholars to women. And Rashi there explains that it is [because] their strength is enfeebled like women. However, according to what has been said [above], it is possible that [the reason] he compares them to women is because they are like women, about whom it is written (Psalms 45:14), "All glorious is the king's daughter inside," and [in this fashion] are involved in Torah, [and, if not,] they [must] overcome their impulse like men, whom the evil impulse cannot [vanquish]. And be exact and find the truth [to this].
It is possible to hint that the word, <i>bereshit,</i>, is [made up of the same letters as] <i>bayit rosh</i> (house head, head sometimes meaning beginning), as it is stated, [a man should] marry a woman and afterwards study Torah. And this is [the meaning here of] house head - a house is always a wife [and having a wife should so be at the] head (first), before being involved in Torah. And after a while, I saw in the Zohar Chadash, page 4 in the Midrash Haneelam, side 1 and side 3, that he expounds [otherwise, as follows:] first (<i>rosh</i>) to prepare the house (<i>bayit</i>) at first and afterwards, should he marry a woman.
The last letters [of the first three words can spell] <i>emett</i> (truth). It is possible to explain that which the [author] of <i>Parshat Derakhim</i> wrote on that which is written in Eruvin 86, "Rabba bar Mari expounded, 'That which is written (Psalms 61:8), "May he always (<i>olam</i>) sit before God, kindness and truth appoint to protect him," [should be understood as:] "May the world (<i>olam</i>) sit before God!" When? When "kindness and truth You appoint to protect it"'" - and the rabbi, of blessed memory wrote that our rabbis, of blessed memory said, "'In the beginning God (<i>Elohim</i> - God's name traditionally associated with His trait of strict judgment) created:' at first, it came up in [His] thought to create [the world] with the trait of strict justice, [and] He saw that the world [would] not [be able to] exist; [so] He brought the trait of mercy in front and combined it with the trait of strict justice. Concerning this is it written (Genesis 2:4), 'on the day that the Lord, God, made earth and heavens' (which has the name of God associated with mercy come before the name, <i>Elohim</i>)." And this is what was difficult to [Rabba bar Mari], how could it say, "the world sits in front of God (<i>Elohim</i>, the name associated with the attribute of strict justice);" is it not that the world cannot exist with the attribute of strict justice? To this he [answered], "When? When 'kindness and truth You appoint to protect it.'" And the intention is [like what] they, of blessed memory, said on the verse, "Look down from your holy abode" (Deuteronomy 26:15); "Come and see the power of gifts to the poor, which transforms the attribute of strict justice to the attribute of mercy, since all [mentions] of looking down in the Torah are for bad except for this one." And, if so, with charity (<i>tsedekah</i>), "the world sits in front of God (<i>Elohim</i>)," since it transforms the attribute of strict justice to the attribute of mercy. Up to here are his words, see there in <i>Derush</i> 18. And they said in Tanna Debei Eliyahu Zuta 1, "There is no truth except <i>tsedekah</i>, as it is stated (Psalms 85:12), 'Truth sprouts from the earth and righteousness (<i>tsedek</i>) looks down from the sky,'" see there. And according to this is elucidated that [which] the verse stated, "In the beginning, <i>Elohim</i> created," which means that it went up in His thought to create the world with the attribute of strict justice, and if you will ask how can the world exist [like that]; for this [reason], it hints with the final letters, 'truth' - which means <i>tsedekah</i>, as it says in the Order of Eliyahu Zuta - which means to say, that through <i>tsedekah</i> the world exists with the attribute of strict justice, since <i>tsedekah</i> transforms the attribute of strict justice to the attribute of mercy. And even though the verse [states] (Psalms 119:160), "The <i>beginning</i> of your word is truth and forever (<i>leolam</i>) is all the judgement of your righteousness;" the intention is [that] "the beginning of your word" - the start of the Torah - "is true" in the final letters, as the commentators have explained. And the intention of the Torah is that "to the world (<i>leolam</i>) is all the judgement (<i>tsedek</i>) of your righteousness," since through this, the world can proceed in judgement, as <i>tsedekah</i> transforms the attribute of strict justice to the attribute of mercy. And this is the meaning of that which is written, "on the day that the Lord, God, made earth and heavens;" since the earth [represents] the poor and the heavens [represents] the rich, as [the author] said in <i>Sefer Haredim</i>, page 81 on the verse (Deuteronomy 32:1), "Give ear, O heavens," see there. And this is [the meaning] of what is written, "on the day that the Lord, God," since He brought the trait of mercy in front and combined it with the trait of strict justice, and if you will say, behold it is written, "In the beginning God (<i>Elohim</i>) created," for this reason did He say, "earth and heavens" - which are the rich and the poor; and with this there will be mercy with the attribute of strict justice and everything will be [properly] arranged.   
It is possible to hint, that which they, of blessed memory, said, "In the merit of two things is Israel purified: in the merit of Shabbat and of the tithes;" [the tithes] being charity (<i>tsedekah</i>). And in our poverty, we explained this statement in that booklet, Parshat Re'eh, with the help of Heaven. And behold, it is possible that at the beginning of the Torah it hints to Israel, that they have a cure in their hands to purify themselves in front of God, in the Shabbat and the tithes. And its hint is in the word, <i>bereishit</i>, which is a combination [of the letters that can form the words,] <i>yerei</i> (fear) Shabbat, as it said in the Tikunei Zohar. And they, of blessed memory, also said, "<i>Bereishit</i> - is in the merit of the tithes, which are called <i>reishit</i> (the beginning of);" and this should be for the salvation of Israel and [the latter] is the [reason] for the existence of the world. At the beginning of the order of Bereishit Rabbah (1:3): "Rabbi Yehoshua of Sakhnin opened in the name of Rabbi Levi, '"The strength of his actions He told His people" (Psalms 111:6); what is the reason that the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to Israel, what He created on the first day and what He created on the second day? Because of the nations of the world, so that they should not designate Israel and say to them, "Are you not a nation of looting?" and Israel will respond to them, "And you, is [the land] not looted in your hands, is it not [written] (Deuteronomy 2:23), 'the Kaftorim that came out of Kaftor destroyed them and dwelt in their place.' The world and its fullness [belong to] the Holy One, blessed be He: when He wanted, He gave it to you; when He wanted, He took it from you and gave it to us. That is what is written (Psalms 111:6), 'to give them the inheritance of the nations,' He told them [what happened with] all of the generations." And Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi found it difficult, [asking] what kind of answer is this, "is [the land] not looted in your hands?" As a result, they will say, "[you are] a thief who steals from a thief" And for this reason, Rabbi Yitzchak did not write [this answer]. And in Bereshit Rabbah, it was given as an extra answer, see there. And it is possible to explain [it] according to that which was asked by the rabbi, the teacher, his honor, our teacher Rabbi Y. Hacohen, may his memory be for a blessing in the life of the world to come, about that which was written in Sanhedrin 59a, "Gentiles are not able to [legally] conquer," since we say [that] Ammon and Moav were 'purified' by Sichon (meaning that by conquering them, Sichon took lands away from Ammon and Moav, which would otherwise have been forbidden for Israel to conquer), but if gentiles are not able to conquer, how were [these lands] 'purified,' as behold, Sichon did not acquire them? And he answered, that it is different [in that case], since this is what God decreed - as it is said in Chullin 60, "The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Let Sichon come and take out from Moav, etc'" - and since God decreed this, certainly the conquest of Sichon is considered a [legal] conquest. Up to here are his words. And we will also sweeten the matter by prefacing it with that which I heard from the complete mighty and great sage, 'both a senior and an elder,' his honor, our teacher and rabbi, Rabbi Haim Pifani, may his memory be for a blessing in the life of the world to come, in the name of the complete sage, the rabbi, his honor, our teacher and rabbi, Rabbi Aharon Sasson, may his memory be for a blessing in the life of the world to come, the author of the booklet, <i>Hen Yislach</i> (which is mentioned by the great rabbi, [the author of] <i>Mishneh LeMelekh</i>), about the intention of the verse in Parshat Devarim (Deuteronomy 2:23-24), "And the Avim who dwelt in open cities as far as Gaza, the Kaftorim that came out of Kaftor destroyed them and dwelt in their place. Rise up, journey and cross the Arnon River, etc." as follows: They said in the Yalkut, Parshat Noach, that the Kaftorim were dwarfs, and they said in Bekhorot, a dwarf should not marry a dwarf-woman, since from [their union] will come a tiny person.  And they, of blessed memory, said [about] the Avim, "Anyone who sees them is seized by a fit (<i>avit</i>). And they also said that Moshe, our teacher, gave a sign to the spies: if they dwell in open (unfortified) cities, without [city] walls, know that they are mighty. And now Moshe is saying to Israel - so that they should not fear from the Canaanites - that everything is in the hands of [God] and they should not fear from the mighty; do you not see that the Avim, who were mighty - [such] that everyone that saw them would be seized by a fit - who lived in unfortified cities, which are open, which is a sign of their might; behold, "the Kaftorim" - dwarfs - "that came out from Kaftor" - whose mothers were dwarf-women [and] who were lowly and scorned and weak - were able to destroy those mighty of reputation and location - "the Avim who dwelt in open cities as far as Gaza... and dwelt in their place." And that is a wonder, and it has to be because [of the fact that] 'not to the mighty is the [victory in] war, but only to God alone.' And since it is so, do not be afraid, "Rise up, journey etc." Up to here is what I heard. Behold, over there in Chullin, they said, "Because Avimelekh made Avraham sware, 'if you will not lie, etc.' the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Let the Kaftorim come and take it away from the Avim - who were the Philistines - and let Israel come and take it away from the Kaftorim.'" From here, [one can] say that this is the intention of the statement [in Bereishit Rabbah above]: The nations of the world [will] designate Israel as a nation of looters and Israel will respond to them, "In fact, it is you [who are looters]; is [the land] not looted in your hands," meaning to say, we are able to [legally] conquer and acquire [land] by conquest; "but the truth is that what is in your hands is looted, since gentiles are not able to [legally] conquer; is it not that "the Kaftorim, etc." (meaning that they came there by conquest which was not legal)." And if you will say that even though gentiles are not able to [legally] conquer, nonetheless in that case, the things appears as if God decreed them like this - since were it not so, how would the Kaftorim, dwarfs, have destroyed the very mighty Avim, but rather it is necessarily the will of the Holy One, blessed be He - and [so] in this case, gentiles are able to conquer [legally]. If so, "the Holy One, blessed be He; when He wanted, He gave it to you, and when He wanted, He took it from you and gave it to us." And we acquire it though conquest by force of law, since we can acquire through conquest and you can not. And also, even if we were not able to conquer [legally]; since God is the one who gave [it], we acquire [it] in the [same] way you acquired [it].
