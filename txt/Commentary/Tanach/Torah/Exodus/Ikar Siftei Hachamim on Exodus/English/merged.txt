...Why did Hashem cover them with the mountain like a tub?  In order that they would accept the Oral Tradition.  Hashem compelled them for their own good, so this the Divine Presence would never depart from them and He could not send them away like the case of an "anusa" of which it is written, ..."he can not send her away all of his days."
