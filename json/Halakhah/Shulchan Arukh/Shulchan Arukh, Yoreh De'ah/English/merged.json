One who is in danger of a great loss can be lenient (beit yosef), and if it was just rinsed a little before salting it is acceptable after the fact. This is the rule if the piece of meat is 60 times the volume of the blood that is on it (Sharei Durah in the name of the Mahari).

Gloss: And there are those who forbid this even after the fact, and this is the custom if there is no great need for the meat [i.e. to feed guests, or shabbat is starting soon. This means that it is permissible to use meat salted on one side even from the outset if there is a need for it.].

And there is no difference between washing in a vessel that is kosher, non-kosher, or dairy.

It is forbidden to cut it with a knife before it gets washed [86] and if cut, the knife must be kashered. Rema: [87] And some permit it to be cut with a knife after it went through it’s required salting time [88] for salt can not affect vessels [89] and it is indeed permitted [90] but the knife must be washed off [91] or thrusted into the ground if the tzir has already dried. Even if it is before the required salting time has passed (53) there is no prohibition on the knife, rather the problem is now that blood had come out from the meat to its surface, if one wants to now wash off that spot and go re-salt it one may do so. If one wants to then go and perform a salting in order to preserve the meat after it has been property salted for blood in a vessel with holes, [92] then the meat must be washed off well and re-salted. It may even be re-salted in a vessel without holes. If one wants [93] to salt meat and eat it roasted without washing one may do so and we are not worried about the blood that is on the salt, for the fire sucks out the blood and the salt can not absorb it. This is when it is salted and put on to be roasted, but if it sat in the salt, the salt absorbs blood, and the meat becomes forbidden. Therefore, it must be washed off well, then roasted, and then it may be eaten. See later on in section 76 regarding the law for meat that was salted without being washed off, and then roasted) ",

This is because [the bottom piece] excretes gravy for a lengthy amount of time, and the entire time that gravy is emitted, [the piece] does not absorb. [This is true] even when much gravy gathers and stands inside of a depression between the pieces of meat - it is permitted. In what case is this dealing? In a case when he salts meat on meat, and even ox meat with kid or lamb meat, and even with chicken - [because] it is impossible for them to finish all the excretions of their gravy before the ox meat finishes excreting its blood. {RMA - in any event, we are accustomed to being strict in the first instance, that each piece which has a depression, as in [the case of] of a complete side of meat, to turn it over, in order that the blood should run off.

A piece which was salted twice is permitted - we don't worry that the secondary salt causes the blood from the first salting to be reabsorbed.} However, meat with fish, even chicken with fish, is forbidden to salt together. This is because the fish ceases excreting all of its gravy before the chicken finishes excreting its blood.

However, if the scales were not removed when it was salted, it is permitted. {RMA - and there are those who forbid the entire fish [not just a peeling] if there wasn't 60 times [the volume] of the chicken, as we estimate in salting 60 times the volume, and such is the custom. And this is specifically referring to an instance where the scales weren't present, as fish skin is a soft membrane and excretes immediately. However, where the scales were present, it is permitted, as they do not excrete [all of their fluids] immediately and [thus] do not absorb from the chickens, because the entire time that they are busy excreting, they will not absorb, as we say about two pieces which were salted together.", 
            "In which cases is this said? When they were salted together, or if the  poultry was salted and the fish was not. (4) However if the fish is salty and  the poultry is not and they were placed beside each other [6] or on top of  each other, even the fish is permitted without removing a klipah. <i>Rema: (5)  [8] And so too if the fish [9] are placed on the poultry </i>they are permitted  even if they were salted together since the blood does not flow from  bottom to top, and it is no worse then a piece placed in the tzir in which  what is protruding from the tzir is permitted. If the fish were placed beside  the poultry [11] only (6) after the [12] poultry lay in their salt for the required  salting time, then even the fish are permitted even though they are both  salty. [13] If fish were salted in a vessel in which meat was salted, the fish  are permitted (7) for the fish do not absorb the blood in the vessel because  the salting has no effect on a vessel [14] That which we say that the fish  are forbidden if salty and the poultry is salty, is only when the fish [15] had  released all of their blood and have been washed, (8) but if they still did  not release their blood and were never salted, they are permitted because  when they release their own blood, they will release the blood they  absorbed from the poultry just like a piece that fell into tzir before being  salted. It is permitted for this reason as will be explained below. [16] See  further in section 91 regarding which salting is considered as roseiach.   ", 
            "(9) Kosher meat that was salted with non-kosher meat, or non-kosher  meat that is salty with kosher meat that is not salty, [17] require the  removal of a klipah if they are touching [18] because even though it does  not absorb from the non-kosher blood, it absorbs from it’s tzir. However, if  the kosher meat is salted and the non-kosher meat is non-salty then it is  permitted even without removing a klipah as long as it is washed. This is  true whether the kosher piece is on the top or on the bottom. (10) There  are those who forbid it if they touch ,[19] and rule that the meat is not  permitted even if they were merely standing close to each other if it  allowed for their juices to touch. Rema: When the non-kosher meat is salty  and the kosher one is not-salty it is still forbidden. [20] See later in section  105 regarding these laws.   ", 
            "(11) That in which we say that it is only forbidden to the extent of a klipah  is dealing with cases where the pieces of meat are lean. However if one of  them is fatty, [21] even if the non-kosher piece is lean and the kosher  piece is fatty, the forbidden juice spreads throughout the meat [22] if the  non-kosher salty piece was on the bottom. This is based on the rules of  tatai gavar. [23] See later on in section 105 how one should act.   ", 
            "[24] There are those who say that meat that was salted is forbidden to  remain sitting in the salt after all its tzir has been released, which is after  twelve hours. This is because it begins to absorb from the drops of blood  that are upon it and on the salt, (12) There are also those that permit it to  lay in its salt for even several days. Initially one should follow the stricter  opinion. (12) but post facto it is permitted.   ", 
            "There are those who forbid placing meat [25] that was not salted at all, [26]  or that was salted and had released all of its blood, with already salted  meat prior to its releasing of its blood. This is because the meat that wasn’t  salted or that was salted and had already released all of its blood now  absorbs what the other piece releases. [27] There are those who permit it  if another salting will take place later since then it will release all of this  newly absorbed blood. (14) [28] And there are those who permit it in any  case. [29] Initially one should follow the stricter opinion. Rema: (15) [30]  Even post-facto we customarily forbid meat [31] that has released all of its  blood and tzir and fell into meat that still did not complete the required  salting time. Some say that meat can release tzir for an entire twenty four  hour period after being salted. (16) [32] If during this time it touched meat  that had not completed the required salting time period, the meat is not  forbidden, and this is indeed the custom. [33] However, if there is no great  loss it should be forbidden if it is after 12 hours, but before this time one  need not be stringent at all, and surely if it had not been salted yet for even  if it had fallen into actual tzir it wouldn’t be forbidden for we say [34] that  when it releases it’s own blood, it will release anything else that it could  have absorbed. Even if the meat has been salted but has not sat for the  required salting time and fell into tzir [35] it may be permitted,[36] if it did  not sit in the tzir for an entire day. [37] If it had sat for the entire salting time  and then fell into tzir, some forbid it even though the releasing of tzir has  not been completed. Nevertheless, in a case of great loss it may be  permitted during the entire time that the meat releases tzir [38] which is  twelve hours [39] if it is re-washed and salted. [40] If it fell into tzir [41]  before the end of the required salting period re-wash and re-salt it. (18)  [42] However, if it was salted without being washed after it had fallen into  tzir [43] it is permitted post facto. All these cases are referring to tzir that  has the status of roseiach as explained in section 69. but blood (dam  b’eyn) that fell on meat [44] during the salting period that is considered  roseiach as explained later on in section 91, causes the meat to be  forbidden, for regarding this blood we don’t say that since the meat is now  in the process of releasing blood, it will release this blood as well, nor do  we say that “as it absorbed so will it release.\" (19) Regarding the case in  which we forbid it when it fell into tzir is only true for the part that is actually  in the tzir [45] but whatever is protruding from the tzir is permitted, [46]  however (20) what is in the tzir becomes forbidden immediately. Meat that  fell into tzir that is on the ground [47] is as if it was in a vessel without  holes. Meat that touched a piece that was salted in a vessel without holes  and became forbidden [48] has the same law as if it had touched tzir. In a  case of doubt of water or tzir, it is permitted, [49] for tzir is of rabbinical  origin so in a case of doubt we are lenient. Tzir mixed with water, [50] even  with only a little water, is no longer considered roseiach and cannot cause  meat to become forbidden. For the laws of soaking see section 105.   "

And if you are not able to whiten the knife through fire well because of the handle, whiten it through fire and dunk in boiling water after. However, if you whitened but did not dunk in boiling water, even if there are dimples, or if you dunked but did not whiten and there are not dimples and you cut something warm it won't be forbidden even if the knife has been used in the previous day, and if you sharpened it well with a whetstone in every place, and dunk it in boiling water afterwords it is effective like whitening through fire if you are able to clean the dimples in it.

And if the senior member of the family goes with him, even those who are here (i.e. who stay in the city) do not count until he is buried.

            "One who drowned in [a body of] water that had an end [i.e. with reasonably close shores], or about whom a rumor went out that thieves killed him or a wild animal dragged him, from when do we count (i.e. shiva and shloshim)? From when they despair of searching (lit. requesting). If they found him dismembered (lit. limbs by limbs) and they identify him by signs on his body they do not count until they find his head and the majority of his body or they despair of searching. And if they find him after they had despaired of finding him, the relatives do not need to go back and mourn; but the sons, if they were present at the moment he was found, they mourn on the same day, since it is not any less significant than the gathering his father’s bones. But if they are not there but they heard after the day had passed, they do not need to mourn. Gloss: If they sent their deceased to another city in which case the law is to start mourning when they turn around, and they began to count the period of mourning, and afterwards, the deceased was captured and it was not possible to be bury him for a long time, they do not need to stop their mourning and they do not need to go back and mourn afterwards, for since their rule is to begin immediately, they do not need to stop."

And it is forbidden to read from the Torah and forbidden to say hello or do laundry, and one is obligated to wrap one’s head and to overturn the bed all seven days (i.e. of shiva). And it is forbidden to lay tefillin on the first day and it is forbidden to iron or to get a haircut, or to be happy and to stitch together the tear all thirty days (and all of the elements of mourning are in effect whether it is day or night)", 
            "Work – how? Throughout the first three days, work is forbidden even if he is a poor person who is sustained by tzedakkah. From this point on, if he is poor and he does not have what to eat, he [works] privately inside his house. And a woman spins on a spindle inside the house. But the hachamim [sages] said that a curse should come upon his neighbors who made it necessary for him to do this.

            "It is forbidden to do work through others (even a non-Jew) unless it is something which has the potential to depreciate since something which depreciates is permitted to be done by others.

Hagah – And there are those who say that if he is not able to do it through others and it is something which depreciates, then it is permitted for the mourner to do it by himself.

            "A mourner is forbidden to engage in greetings. How does this work? For the first three days he does not greet anyone and if others do not know that he is mourning and greet him, he should not respond to them. Rather, he should inform them that he is mourning. From the third to the seven day, he should not greet people, but if others do not know that he is mourning and greet him, he should respond. From the seventh day to the 30th day, he can greet others, for they are dwelling peacefully, but others should not greet him. And all the more so, he can respond to one who greets him. After 30 days he is like any other person. To what does this [the previous laws] refer? For his other relatives, but for his father and mother, he can greet others after seven days but others should not greet him until after 12 months. Rema: And since he is forbidden from greeting, all the more so [is he forbidden from] being overly talkative. But if he is acting for the honor of the public, for example, many people are coming to greet comfort him, he is permitted to say to them, “go home in peace,” because this is permitted for the honor of the public. And there are those who are lenient in this age [regarding] greeting a mourner after 30 days, and they don’t have a [good]reason, unless they will make a distinction and say that that which we do is not called [i.e. considered like] the “greeting” that was in their day", 
            "One who finds his fellow a mourner in the first 30 days, he should comfort him but should not greet him. After 30 days he can greet him, but should not comfort him in the usual manner, rather in an subtle way, namely, that he should not mention to him the name of the deceased, rather he should say to him, “be comforted.” If his wife died and he married someone else, one should not enter [the mourner’s] house to comfort him. If he found him in the marketplace he should say to him, “be comforted,” in a soft voice and with seriousness. But if he has not remarried he should comfort him until 3 festivals have passed. And for one’s father or mother one should comfort him all 12 months and after 12 months one should comfort him in an subtle way."

            "A mourner is prohibited in joy; therefore he should not take a baby in his bosom all of Shiva, because perhaps he will come to levity.", 
            "For all dead one enters the drinking house after 30 days; for his father or for his mother, after the 12th month. And even if the year is intercalated [such that it has 13 months] one is permitted to after 12 months… Rama: And a gathering for a mitzvah, such as one who marries a male or female orphan for the sake of Heaven, and if he does not eat there the thing will not happen, he is allowed to after 30 days, but during the 30 days he cannot go to any Mitzvah meals in the world. But a Mitzvah meal where there is not joy he is allowed to attend, such as a Pidyon HaBen or a Brit Milah meal, and he is allowed to eat there even if it is during the Shiva, provided that he does not leave his home. And there are those who forbid eating at the meal of a Brit Milah and the custom is to not eat in any banquet during the 12 months if it is outside of his home, and inside the home we are lenient and he can eat during the Brit Milah meal and all the more so during meals that do not have joy. But in the wedding meal one should be stringent for it—so it seems to me. A mourner who is the father of a son to be circumcised or is a Mohel may wear clothes for Shabbat until after the Bris and he is allowed to attend the Bris to eat there if it is after the 30 days even though the Bris is not in his home.", 
            "To attend a Chupah not during the time of eating, to hear the blessings, there are those who permit and there are those who forbid; rather he should stand outside the house to hear the blessings. Rama: But do not enter the house at all when they are engaged in entertaining the Bride and Groom, and such is the Ashkenazic custom and in these countries. And all of this applies to a where the wedding occurs, but the Chuppah that they do in the synagogue, where they recite the blessings over the bethrothal and the marriage, and this is not considered festive, he is allowed to attend immedately after the Shiva is over, and there are those who forbid until after 30 days, and so it appears to me. And there are places that are strict for the mourner to stay during the 12 months outside the synagogue to hear the blessings, and in any case it appears that the Mourner can bless the betrothal and wedding blessings beneath the Chuppah that is in the synagogue and he can bring in the groom, as is the custom of our land, that two people bring in the groom under the Chuppah. And he can wear some Shabbat clothes at the time that he brings him in, and only if this is after the 30 days and this is the custom. There are those who permit the mourner to eat at a wedding meal or at a Bris with the servants, but only if it is not at the place of joy, for example, at another house. And there are those who forbid this, and such is the custom. Rather, the mourner should do some service there, if he wants, and eat in his house from what was sent from the meal. There are those who permit him to eat at that meal of fish that is made after the wedding, for since they have already ended saying “that the joy that we have is in God’s midst,” there is a reminder that there is not festivity in that meal, so it is permitted. There are those who say it is forbidden for one to eat in a meal at night in the day after the death of a mother or father."
