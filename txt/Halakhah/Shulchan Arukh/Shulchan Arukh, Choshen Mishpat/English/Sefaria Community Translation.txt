Siman 1

In these time judges judge the laws of  confessions to a loan, loans, kesuba of a woman, inheritance, gifts, and cases which damage anothers money(assets, or income) because these cases are common always. Case which are not common even though there is a loss of money for example a animal that wounds another animal, or cases which are common but don't have a loss of money  such as paying double (when fined for stealing an item) and such is the case with all fines that the sages instituted like a fine for when someone blows in into his friends ear and scares him, or hits his friend, and so to in any case where they required one to pay more then the principal amount of damage or where you would be required half the damage we don't judge them. they may only be judged by specialist who have smicha in Israel. Except in the case where you pay half the damage for damage caused by pebbles (such as when an animal walks and it kicks up pebbles and they cause damage) because this is a loss of money, and not a fine (a fine is extra punishment to the value of a principle damage) 

Siman 2



Siman 3

There is no Beit Din with less than three. And three is called, "Beit Din," even with regular people. (because it is not possible that not one of them knows the logical processes of law, but if none of them know, they are invalid to judge. (Tur in the name of his father, the Rosh, in the beginning of Sanhedrin) but in any case, they are able to accept the [possibility of] error, and send them before a teacher.) (Maharam Paduah, Section 43) And they may judge a man against his will if the defendant refuses to go down to judgement or if he does not want to be judged with the prosecutor in his town. But, if he wants to be judged with him in his town, but does not want to be judged by the three judges that the prosecutor chose, then he [the defendant] chooses one judge, and he [the prosecutor] chooses one judge. Note: Like what is taught later on in Section 13. And it seems to me that this is specifically with judges that were not set, but if there are judges that were set in the city, he may not say, "I will not be judged before them, rather with this [judge], I choose," and this is the practice in our town. And see later Section 22 end of paragraph 1.

Siman 7

A court of three of which one is a convert is inelligible to judge an Israelite unless his [the convert's] mother  (or father) is from Israelites and a convert can judge his fellow convert even though his [the judge's] mother is not from Israelites.
A mamzer (a child born from incest or adultery), and even if all three are mamzers, these are elligible to judge for everything; and so too if each of them were blind in one of their eyes they would be elligible, but one who is blind in both of his eyes is inelligible.
Some say that he is not worthy to judge unless he is 18 or older and has brought two hairs [to demonstrate that he has reached puberty], and some say that he is elligible from 13 and older even if he has not brought to hairs.
A women is inelligible to judge.






A court of 3 requires that there be in each of them 7 things: Wisdom, humility, fear (of heaven), hatred of money, love of the truth, love of the creations to them and possessors of a good name (See Chapter 8 Section 1).

Siman 8

Anyone who appoints a judge who is not proper and not wise in the wisdom of the Torah and not fitting to be a judge, even though is completely desirable and has other good traits, behold this person who appointed him violates a negative precept. Hagah: And it is forbidden to appoint an ignoramus as a judge with the assumption that he will ask a wise man every time. (B"Y) And cities that there is not in them wise men who are fitting to be judges, or where they are all ignoramuses, and they need judges to rule between them so that they not go to courts of idol worshipers, we appoint the best and wisest among them (based on the opinion of the people of the city), even though they are not fitting to be judges. And since the people of the city accepted (them) upon themselves, nobody else is able to disqualify them. And similarly, every community is able to accept upon themselves a Bais Din even though they are not fitting according to the Torah. (B"Y quoting Tshuvos HaRashb"a) And any judge who was appointed because of silver or gold, it is forbidden to stand before him. And not only that, rather it is a commandment to belittle and deride him.

Siman 9



Siman 10

The judge needs to be deliberate in judgement, so that he will not rule on it until he processes it and deals with it, and it is clear to him like the Sun. And one who is haughty of heart in ruling, and who jumps and rules on the judgement before he investigates it well to himself, until it is clear to him like the Sun - he is an idiot, evil, and haughty of spirit.

It is prohibited to go in for judgement before gentile judges or a gentile court, even if they were to judge according to how Jewish law would rule in a particular case, and even if both parties - the plaintiff and defendant - had agreed to go in for judgment by these judges. It is nevertheless prohibited, and any who use these courts is a rasha (evil one), and it is as if they have insulted and raised their hand against the Torah of Moses.

One who hires workers and said to them "work from dawn till dusk", cannot force them to do so if that is not the custom of the area, even if he adds to their salary. This is because he did not make this stipulation at the moment he hired them. [Rema: (meaning that it was not the case that) there was not a particular custom in the city or that he said to them "I hire you according to Torah law and you are obligated to leave from your houses at sunrise and work until nightfall" (Tur 331:4). (In these cases) on the eve of Shabbat the worker goes home early so he can fill a barrel of water and roast a small fish and light the Shabbat candles (Tur 331:5 based on the Talmud Yerushalmi). If there was no custom in the city but the majority of the men in the city come from an area where there is a custom, we go according to the custom of the city from which they come. If they came from a place where the custom is to work from dawn to dusk to a place where that is not the custom, or the reverse, we go according to the custom of the place in which they were hired (Nemukei Yosef on the beginning of Chapter 7 of Bava Metzia, "One Who Hires Worker", based on the Talmud Yerushalmi). Something is not a custom unless it a common practice and has been done many times, however, something which has been done only once or twice is not considered a custom (Rivash siman 475).]
A place that is accustomed to nourish, nourishes; to provide in dried figs or dates and it is like he has fulfilled his obligation in them, he will provide; everything according to the custom of the state.

Siman 334

One who hires a worker to water the field from this river, and the river stops up for half the day, if there isn’t any way to stop or even that his way is to interrupt and the worker knows the way of the river, the loss of the worker and the employer doesn’t give him anything, even though that also the employer knows the way of the river. But if the worker doesn’t know the way of the river, and the employer knows, he gives the worker workman’s comp. Note: and similarly in every case of extraordinary circumstance that happens to the worker, whether the two of them knew that the way of the compulsion to come or the two of them didn’t know, it comes to be the loss of the worker. But if the employer knows and the worker doesn’t know, it comes to be the loss is of the employer. And if a naturally occurring complete disaster comes consider above siman 321. Someone that rents a house to live in it, and dies within the time of the rental, doesn’t have to pay only the time that he dwelled in it, because  the owner of the house comes to be like the worker, and he should have made it a condition. There are those who disagree. Therefore, if he received all the rent payment, there is no need to return them all, so it seems to me. If they run away because of a change in weather, it comes to be like the other forces, and it comes to be the loss of the worker or the teacher. 


Who that hires a teacher for his son, and the student is sick, if it isn’t a chronic sickness [and the same applies if the boy dies], and even if it is regular and the teacher is from the city and is aware of it, the loss is of the teacher. But if it is a regular sickness, and the teacher is not aware of it, for example that he isn’t from the city, the loss is on the one who hires him, and he gives to him all the owed wages. [Note: of all the students of Torah find it more comfortable for them to learn than to have their nights filled with nothingness. And consider below, Siman 335. etc]

The Mitzvah is to give a hired worker a wage in its time, and after that, he transgresses a negative commandment; whether paying man or for a beast or tools. But for paying for ground, there are those who that say that there is no transgression.  

Which time is this, hired by day, the time to give it to him is all night; if it is not given to him, he [the employer] transgressed it in the morning because of the prohibition of holding onto the wages (from Vayikra 19:13). Hired by night, the time to give it to him is all day; it is not given to him, he [the employer] transgressed it in the evening, because of “At this day you shall give him his hire” (Devarim 24:15). Note: And the workers to them, that there isn’t making work until night, since that investment upon him a hot transgression upon him because of “At this day you shall give him his hire”; at night, and if he made work until night, he has time even though that his didn’t pay him according to his proper fee. 
Hourly workers, if its paid to him on the day he has to pay him every day; if its paid to him at night he has to pay him every night.
A weekly worker, monthly worker, yearly worker, weekly worker, he will go out on height of the day every same day; he will go out on the height of the night every same night.
He gives shawl to the artisan to fix it as a contractor, and he finished it, all the time that the shawl is in the hand of the artisan you do not transgress [by withholding pay]. He [the artisan] gave it to him [the owner of the garment] even in the middle day, until the sun sets [you have until the sunset to pay for the mend], he transgressed because of Bal Talin/Don’t withhold, that contractor is like his hiring to repay on time.

It is forbidden to steal even if it is a small amount according to the judgment of the Torah and it is forbidden to steal, even if it is in a playful manner, even on the condition of returning it or in order to repay double or in order to cause pain.  Everything is forbidden in order that he not accustom himself to this. 
Anyone who steals even on par with a penny’s worth transgressed not stealing and he is obligated to pay, one that steals money of a Jew or who steals money of a non-Jew and one that steals from the great or from the small. Note: a gentile’s mistake, for example to mistake in counting or repaying his loans, is permitted, and provided that he doesn’t know, so that there is no blasphemy. And there are those who say that it is forbidden to mislead him except if he makes the mistake from his own, and then it’s allowed.

Any item that is assumed to be stolen, it is forbidden to buy it. And so, if the majority of that item is stolen, we don't buy it. Therefore, we do not buy wool, milk, or kids from shepherds. However, we do buy milk and cheese from  them in the wilderness, but not in the settled area. And it is permitted to buy four sheep or four shearings of wool from shepherds, from a small flock, or five from a large flock, since it is not assumes to be stolen. In general, anything that the shepherd would sell if the owner was monitoring him is permitted to buy, and if not, is forbidden.

<i><b>Rema</b>: Regarding those guilty of the death penalty in our days, we have no power to give them lashes, exile them, kill them, or beat them. Instead we censure them and distance them from the community (<b>Tur 68</b> from Natronai Gaon). Thus far regarding [strictly Torah] law. However, if the beit din sees a necessity for a preventative measure, it has the authority to institue whatever punishment they see fit (ibid., from the Responsa of the Natronai Gaon), as explained above in Siman 2. This regards those instances involving capital punishment which necessitates a beit din. Cases in which the death penalty can be implemented even without a beit din, are still judged in our days, as will be explained (ibid.).</i> One who pursuses his fellow in order to kill him, and was warned, and continued in his pursuit: Even if the pursuer was a minor, every Jew is commanded to save the pursed, even at the cost of one maiming one of the pursuer's limbs. If it is impossible to save the pursued without killing the pursuer outright, then the pursuer should indeed be killed, even though he has not yet performed the act. <i><b>Rema</b>: (<b>Tur 67</b>) One who "tunnels [into a house] in order steal" has this rule of pursuer applied to him, however if it is understood that his only intent is monetary gain, and that he would not kill the owner in a confrontation, then it is forbidden to kill him. See further in the Tur in this paragraph regarding one who endangers the public, such as a Jew who engages in forgery in a land where the authorities take a strict approach to such action, such a person constitutes a "pursuer" and it is permitted to turn him over to the authorities (<b>Nimukei Maharam MiRizburg</b>), as explained above in 388:12.</i>
