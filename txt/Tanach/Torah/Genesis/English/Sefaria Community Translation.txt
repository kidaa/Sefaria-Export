Genesis

Chapter 1

Cuando Elohim comezó a crear los cielos y la tierra

Chapter 2

And the heaven and the earth were finished, and of their host.
And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating had made.
These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven.
No shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground;
but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed.
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
And the name of the third river is Tigris; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to work it and to guard it.
And the LORD God commanded the man, saying: ‘Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’
And the LORD God said: ‘It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.’
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof.
And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.
And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof.
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.
And the man said: ‘This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.’
Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

Now the LORD said to Abram: ‘Go out out of your country, and away from your family, and away from your father’s house, to the land that I will show you.
And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and you will be a blessing.
And I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse those that curse you; and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.’
So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy five years old when he went out of Haran.
And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their belongings that they had gathered, and the souls that they had acquired in Haran; and they went out to go to the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the tree of Moreh. And the Canaanites were in the land then.
And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said: To your seed I will give this land’; and there he built an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.
And he moved from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el to the west, and Ai to the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.
And Abram journeyed on, towards the South.
10. And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was harsh in the land.
And it came to pass, when he came near to entering Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: ‘Now, I know that you are a woman beautiful appearance.
And it will be, when the Egyptians shall see you, that they will say: This is his wife; and they will kill me, but you they will keep alive.
Please say, you are my sister; that it may be better for me, for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.’
Now, when Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful.
And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-donkeys, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-donkeys, and camels.
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.
And Pharaoh called Abram, and said: ‘What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?
Why did you say: She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife; now here is your wife, take her, and go your way.’
And Pharaoh commanded men concerning him; and they escorted him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.

Chapter 22

After these events, Elohim tested Avraham and said to him, “Avraham!” and he [Avraham] said, “Here I am.”
[Elohim] said, “Please take your son, your only one, who you love — Yitzhak — and go to the land of Moriah
Avraham readily awoke early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took his two attendants with him, and also his son, Yitzhak. He split the wood for the burnt-offering, rose, and went to the place that Elohim had designated to him.
On the third day, Avraham  raised his eyes and saw the place from afar.
Avraham said to his attendants, “Remain here with the donkey and I and the boy will go to that place. We will worship [‘prostrate ourselves’] and we will return to you.”
Avraham took the wood of the burnt-offering and placed it on his son Yitzhak. In his hand he took the fire and the knife, and they both went together.
Yitzhak spoke to Avraham, his father, and said, “Father,” and he [Avraham] said, “Here I am, my son.” He [Yitzhak] said, “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt-offering?”
Avraham said, “Elohim will show the lamb for the offering, my son.” And the two of them went together.
They came to the place that Elohim had designated to him. Avraham built the altar there, and arranged the wood. He bound his son Yitzhak and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood.
Avraham extended his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
An angel of Adonai called to him from heaven and said, “Avraham! Avraham!” and he said, “Here I am.”
[The angel of Adonai] said, “Do not touch the lad, nor do anything  to him, because now I know you are in awe/fear of God, seeing as you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”
Avraham looked up, and he saw that — behold! — a ram was caught in the thicket by his horns. Avraham went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt-offering in place of his son.

Chapter 31

And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying: ‘Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this wealth.’
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.
And the LORD said unto Jacob: ‘Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.’
And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
and said unto them: ‘I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.
And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
And your father hath mocked me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
If he said thus: The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said thus: The streaked shall be thy wages; then bore all the flock streaked.
Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
And the angel of God said unto me in the dream: Jacob; and I said: Here am I.
And he said: Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
I am the God of Beth-el, where thou didst anoint a pillar, where thou didst vow a vow unto Me. Now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.’
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him: ‘Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
Are we not accounted by him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our price.
For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s. Now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.’
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;
and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.
Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep. And Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.
And Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, in that he told him not that he fled.
So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over athe River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night, and said unto him: ‘Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.’
And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mountain of Gilead.
And Laban said to Jacob: ‘What hast thou done, that thou hast outwitted me, and carried away my daughters as though captives of the sword?
Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and outwit me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;
and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt; but the God of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying: Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
And now that thou art surely gone, because thou sore longest after thy father’s house, wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?’
And Jacob answered and said to Laban: ‘Because I was afraid; for I said: Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live; before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.’—For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.—
And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the saddle of the camel, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.
And she said to her father: ‘Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me.’ And he searched, but found not the teraphim.
And Jacob was wroth, and strove with Laban. And Jacob answered and said to Laban: ‘What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?
Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.
These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.
That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bore the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
Thus I was: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.
These twenty years have I been in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been on my side, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and gave judgment yesternight.’
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob: ‘The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day for these my daughters, or for their children whom they have borne?
And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.’
And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
And Jacob said unto his brethren: ‘Gather stones’; and they took stones, and made a heap. And they did eat there by the heap.
And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha; but Jacob called it Galeed.
And Laban said: ‘This heap is witness between me and thee this day.’ Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
and Mizpah, for he said: ‘The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives beside my daughters, no man being with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.’
And Laban said to Jacob: ‘Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set up betwixt me and thee.
This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us.’ And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.
And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
