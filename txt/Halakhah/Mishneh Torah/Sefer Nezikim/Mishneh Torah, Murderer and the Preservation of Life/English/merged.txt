Mishneh Torah, Murderer and the Preservation of Life

Chapter 1


It is a commandment for the redeemer of blood [to kill the murderer] as it says, "The redeemer of blood shall kill the murderer (Numbers 35:19)."  And everyone who is worthy to inherit, he is the redeemer of blood.  If he does not want to be the redeemer of blood or if he is unable to kill him or if there is no redeemer of blood, the court kills the murderer by decapitation.






... It is a negative commandment that one should not protect the life of a rodef (pursuer). For this reason, the sages ruled that in the case of a pregnant woman in a dangerous labor, it is permissible to dismember the fetus in her womb - whether with a drug or by hand because it is like a rodef pursuing her to kill her. However, once his head has emerged one may not touch him, as we do not set aside one nefesh [soul] for another, and this is the natural way of the world.




Anyone who can save and does not save transgresses 'do not stand by the blood of your neighbour'. So too one who sees his friend drowning in the sea, bandits attacking him or a bad animal attacking him and he is able himself to save him or he could hire others to save him but he does not; one who hears idol worshippers or informers plotting harm for him or laying a trap for him and he doesn't tell his friend and inform him; or if he knows that an idol worshipper or a thug are on their way to his friend and he could appease them on behalf of his friend to change their intention and he doesn't appease him; and so too any similar case; One who does any of these transgresses 'do not stand idly by your neighbour's blood'.

Chapter 4









One does not do this matter in the remainder of instances where the death penalty can be imposed by the court, but if one is liable for execution, they should execute him and if one is not liable for execution they should free him.  That even if there transgressions that are weightier than the spilling of blood, they are not as corrupting to society as the spilling of blood.  Even idolatry and it does not need to be said, forbidden sexual relations or the desecration of the Sabbath are not like the spilling of blood.  That these transgressions are offenses between a person and God, but the spilling of blood  is an offense between people.  And everyone who has in his hand this sin, see, he is completely evil and all the commandments that one has done in his lifetime cannot balance against this sin and will not save him from judgment.  As it is said, "A person weighed down with the blood of a life, etc, (Proverbs 28:17)."  Go and learn from the example of Ahab who performed acts of idolatry, that behold it is said concerning him, "There are none like Ahab (I Kings 21:25)." And when his merits and his sins were weighted before the Lord of Spirits, no sin was found that merited the death penalty that was not balanced by another matter except the blood of Navot. As it says, "And the spirit came out and stood before God (I Kings 22:21)."  This is the spirit of Navot. And as it says concerning him, "You will entice and you will prevail (I Kings 22:22)."  Behold, the evil one did not kill with his hands, rather brought it about, how much the more so if he had killed with his own hands.

Chapter 6






How [or in what circumstance]? The one who throws a stone into the public domain and it kills [someone] or the one who is taking down his wall into the public domain and a stone fell and it killed [someone]. Either when he took it down during the day or when he took it down at night, behold, he is [considered] grossly negligent and is not exiled [to the city of refuge] because it is a crime, because he should have looked and [only then] afterwards he can throw [the stone] or take down the wall.
If he takes down the wall into the garbage heap at night, if many people are common there, behold, he is [considered] grossly negligent and is not exiled [to the city of refuge]. If many people are not common there at all, behold, it is [considered to be] a freak accident and he is exempt from exile.
If there was a garbage heap that people regularly use [as a bathroom] at night and it is not regularly used [as a bathroom] during the day, and a person is found there, sitting [and using the bathroom], and a stone fell on him at the time of the taking down [of the wall] and he dies, behold, he is exiled.
And this [is also the case when], the one who throws a stone and after it left his hand, that person put out his head and he received [the stone to his face and he died, the thrower] is exempt from exile, as it is said, "and it found his friend” (Deuteronomy 19:5) excludes the one who places himself [in danger].


Chapter 7

A scholar who is exiled to a city of refuge, his teacher is exiled with him, as it says, "[And he shall flee to one of these cities] and live (Deuteronomy 19:5)."  Give him [his teacher]in order that he may live and a scholar must have his teacher because without Torah study, one is thought to be dead.  Similarly, if a teacher is exiled, his academy is exiled with him.

Chapter 12












It is forbidden to sell to a gentile any instrument of war; nor may you sharpen their swords, nor may you sell them any knives, manacles, iron chains, nor bears, lions, nor anything that could cause damage to the public.  But you may sell them shields to be used defensively.
