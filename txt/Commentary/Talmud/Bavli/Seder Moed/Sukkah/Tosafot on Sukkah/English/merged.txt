It seems from here that women are exempt from reciting Hallel on Sukkos and Shavuos because it is a time-bound positive mitzvah. Although the Gemara implies that women are obligated in the four cups of wine on the first nights of Pesach, and the rabbis ostensibly only instituted the four cups to enhance the recitation of Hallel and Maggid, Hallel of Pesach is different because it commemorates the miracle and [women] also were part of the miracle.

Daf 38b



Line 1

In Rava's town (lit. "place") they were all experts in Hallel, and they would all recite Hallel along with the <i>shaliach tzibbur</i>, just as we recite it nowadays. And they did not rely on him (i.e. his recital) at all, as Rashi explains. (WILL FINISH LATER)
