            "One should strengthen himself like a lion to get up in the morning to serve his Creator, so that it is he who awakens the dawn. Rem\"a: At least, one should not delay beyond the time when the congregation prays (Tur). Rem\"a: \"I have set the Lord before me constantly\" (Psalms 16:8); this is a major principle in the Torah and amongst the virtues of the righteous who walk before God. For a person's way of sitting, his movements and his dealings while he is alone in his house are not like his way of sitting, his movements and his dealings when he is before a great king; nor are his speech and free expression as much as he wants when he is with his household members and his relatives like his speech when in a royal audience. All the more so when one takes to heart that the Great King, the Holy One, Blessed Is He, Whose glory fills the earth, is standing over him and watching his actions, as it is stated: \"'Will a man hide in concealment and I will not see him?' - the word of God\" (Jeremiah 23:24), he immediately acquires fear and submission in dread of God, May He Be Blessed, and is ashamed of Him constantly (Guide for the Perplexed III 52). And one should not be ashamed because of people who mock him in his service of God, and should also go modestly. And when he lies on his bed he should know before Whom he lies, and as soon as he wakes up from sleep he should rise eagerly to the service of his Creator, May He Be Blessed and Exalted (Tur).", 
            "One who arises to supplicate before his creator should aim for the hours when the heavenly watches are changing, which are at one-third of the night, and at the end of two-thirds of the night, and at the end of the night; for prayer which is offered at these times regarding the destruction [of the Temple] and regarding the exile is favorable.",

Or he should say to a woman [who doing the spinning] \"spin me fringes for a shawl.\" And if the strings were not spun for their purpose, they are unfit.",

            " If all the strings on the corner have torn, and there remains upon them enough to tie all of the torn strings together, then they are kosher, and if not enough remains to tie them together, even on only one of those that has torn, then they are all invalid. Therefore, since every one of them is doubled over to make two [strings], if two ends have torn off then the tzitzis are invalid, because it could be that one string has torn [at both ends]. According to our practice - which is to be carefule when making Tzitzis to place a mark on four of the ends in such a way that these four ends are always on the same side of the knot, and the four [doubled] ends are on the other side - if two ends tear off on the same side, the Tzitzis are still Kosher, because certainly these are two [different] strings, and each one still has its second end which is more than \"long enough to tie.\" Rabbeinu Tam only accepts [Tzitzis] in a case where two complete strings remain - meaning four ends which each have a full 12-knuckle length [which is required when making new tzitzis]. Therefore he will accept them even when the other two tzitzis have torn - if they still have \"enough to tie\" - but if three have torn, even though they still have \"enough to tie\", they are invalid. Because of this, when three ends have torn, if at the time the Tzitzis were made he was not careful to ensure recognition of the four ends that came from one side of the [initial] knot, we are concerned that perhaps every end comes from a different string, and therefore there is only one complete string left - so because of this doubt we must invalidate the Tzitzis. However, if only two ends have torn, they are Kosher if \"enough to tie\" remains. The law follows the first opinion [which said that even if three or four threads are torn off, the Tzitzis are still Kosher as long as we know that each one is a torn end of a different string]. However, it is good to be concerned for Rabbeinu Tam's opinion where possible. Rem\"a: Our custom is to follow Rabbeinu Tam. Rem\"a: All the more so [according to Rabbeinu Tam], if he was precise to ensure recognition of the four ends that come from one side, and three strings tore all on one side, then the Tzitzis are posul, because we are certain that three threads have torn, and even if they tear on two different sides, we are concerned that possibly three different threads are involved.\n"

Regarding a Jew actively breaking a rabbinic prohibition, there are some who allow it even if he does not have an endangered body part. There are those who say that if he has an endangered body part we break and if he doesn't, we do not break. There are those who say that if he doesn't have an endangered body part, we desecrate with a slight change, and if he has an endangered body part, we break without a change. And there are those who say that even if he has an endangered body part, we do not break any prohibition that is related to a Toraitic labor, and things that have no connection, we do even if he does not have an endangered body part. This third position is right. Rem\"a: It is permitted to tell a non-Jew to cook something for a child that has nothing to eat, because the needs of a child are comparable to a non-endangered sick person.

            "Ceramic dishes that have been used for hametz the whole year, even if they were used for oats or other grains, should be wiped well such that there is no noticeable hametz left, and then it is permitted to keep them until after Passover and use them either for what they were used for before Passover or something different. They should be hidden on Passover in a hidden place where one does not normally go, lest one come to use them on Passover. It is good to close them in a room and to hide the key. But refiring it in fire does not work for any ceramic item that was used for hot things, even if it was not used on the fire and boiling liquid was just poured into it. Rem\"a: There are those who forbid even for the second container (the Magid chapter 5). Even if they are filled with coals, we are concerned that he will be worried that the containers will crack (meaning that they will break) and will not do a complete refiring. However, if he returns them to the furnace where they make new ceramic items, it is permitted. Because they are sent into a big fire like this, clearly he will not be concerned that they will break. But this is not true of our ovens. Rem\"a: For every object that needs to be made white-hot or scalding, it is forbidden to use it even for cold things without kashering it (Mordechai at the beginning of Chapter Kol Shaah). See in Yoreh Deah Chapter 421.", 
            "If a kuvia, which is a object made of bricks and dirt, and one bakes on fries in it, or also a small oven called a pidlya, are refired from the outside, it is forbidden to bake in it on Passover, because the hametz inside is not removed. If it is filled with coals on the inside, it is permitted.", 
            "Knives should be scoured in the first vessel and then they are permitted. The first vessel was where water was boiled on the fire, even if it is not now on the fire but is still boiling. Before the scouring, they must be cleaned well with a whetstone or a millstone to remove all rust before they are kashered. Therefore, if there are crevices such that they can't be adequately cleaning, it is not sufficient to scour them (the meaning of [the word \"hagalah\" - scouring] is spitting, because the objects spit out the prohibition in them, and it comes from the language of \"Their cow calves and does not cast her calf\" [(Job 21:10)]) alone, and they need to be made white-hot where there are crevices. Rem\"a: The sheath of the knives cannot be fixed by scouring, and it is forbidden to put the knife in it on Passover (Mahari\"l).", 
            "Objects used on the fire, like skewers and gridirons and similar things, need to be made white-hot (libun). Libun is such that there are sparks on them. Rem\"a: Some are lenient if it is hot such that straw burns on it from the outside (Mordechai the end of Avoda Zara and Hagahot Maimoni chapter 17 from the Laws of Forbidden Foods). We follow the first opinion for everything that requires libun, but for something that needs scouring but has cracks or we are stringent to make it white-hot, it is sufficient to do this lesser libun. A tripod needs libun (Mahari\"l).", 
            "Objects that were used with hot food should be kashered according to their use. If they are used with a first container, like a spoon that was used in the pot, they must be kashered in a first container. If they are used in a second container, they must be kashered in a second container. For an object that was used when pouring from a first container, it is not sufficient to kosher it in a second container; rather, it must be poured on from a first container. Rem\"a: All objects that have cracks or crevices or rust inside them such that it is not possible to pick at them and remove them require libun where they have cracks or rust (Rashba in a responsa).", 
            "For every object, we follow how it is most used. Therefore, dishes, even if they are sometimes used in a first container on the fire, because they are most often used by pouring from a first container, they should be kashered thus. Rem\"a: There are some who are stringent to scour them in a first container (Tur in the name of Avi Haezri and Mordechai Chapter Kol Sha'ah, and Tosafot at the end of Tractate Avoda Zara), and such is the practice. The same is true for everything where there is a concern that it was used in a first container, like spoons and the like (Hagahot Maimoni chapter 5). There are some who are stringent to scour every cup, even though it is used for cold liquids, because sometimes it is used for hot liquids (Rabbenu Yerucham), and it is the practice o scour them, but after the fact, washing them is sufficient. For big pots that cannot be inserted into a first container, one should put a white-hot rock on top of them and pour boiling water from a first container, and it is as if [they are being kashered in] a first container. The rock should be moved around the whole pot, because then it the whole thing is scoured (Mordechai chapter Kol Sha'ah and Hagahot Maimoni chapter 5 and Agur and Issur vHeiter Principle 58).", 
            "There is one who says that spoons made of ivory cannot be scoured. Because they are ruined in hot water, the concern is that [the owner] will be worried about them [and not kasher them sufficiently].", 
            "Wooden, stone, and metal objects are kashered by scouring. Rem\"a: Also bone vessels require scouring (Mordechai Chapter Kol Sha'ah).", 
            "If one scours before the fifth hour [on the day before Passover], he can scour first containers, second containers, and objects that only absorbed a small amount together, and he need not worry (it is also true that he can scour an object two times) (his own words).", 
            " For baskets in which meat is salted, some require scouring. There is one who disagrees, and he seems right. (It is good to scour them or to purchase new ones.)", 
            "A pan that is fried (meaning that oil is put on it to cook) on is permitted by scouring. If it is long, one side is put [in the water], then it is flipped and other side is put in. If it is even longer, the middle should get libun. (Any libun such that straw burns on it is sufficient. There are some who are stringent to do libun for a pan, but any libun is sufficient as long as straw burns when placed on the outside (his own words). The practice is to do libun a priori, but scouring is sufficient if there are no crevices (Mahari\"l)).", 
            "All objects' handles require the same scouring as the objects. Rem\"a: However, if one did not scour the handles, it is not forbidden after the fact, and even a priori, it is permissible to scour the handles by pouring [hot water] on them (Long Issur vHeiter Principle 58).", 
            "If an object has a patch and the patch was put on before the prohibited substance was absorbed, the patch need not be removed, because the [prohibition] is emitted the same way that it was absorbed. If the absorption predated the patch, the patch must be removed before scouring, or coals should be put on the place of the patch until the prohibited substance would burn if it were there, and afterwards the whole object can be scoured. If [the patch] is wooden, there is no way to kasher it except for by widening the gap such that it is possible to remove what is inside. Rem\"a: Regarding, impressions that the artisans make on dishes, it is permissible to scour them, as they are there initially. They should be scraped out well (Issur vHeiter and Hagahot).", 
            " The iron cover that covers the pot requires scouring, because it sweats from the heat of the pot. If it was placed on the pot during Passover without scouring, the entire dish is forbidden, because the sweat of the cover mixes with the dish.", 
            "The iron cover that is placed over a cake when it is baked on a stove requires libun.", 
            "A mortar requires scouring. If it is too big to be put into the pot, we put boiling water in it and then insert a hot stone and the boiling water overflows onto all sides. Everything like this is considered scouring with a first container. Rem\"a: There are some who are stringent and do libun for a mortar (Tur Yoreh Deah in the name of Rabbi Yoel and the responsa of the Rashb\"a and the Tur in the name of Rash\"i and Rabbenu Tam), but any libun such that straw will burn from the outside is sufficient (his own words). And the practice is to do libbun a priori, but scouring is sufficient if there are no crevices. If the mortar is wooden, one should peel it with an artisan's tools, because we are concerned about crevices. Afterwards, it should be scoured (Hagahot Maimoni chapter 5).", 
            "The sheet on which [dough] is arranged the whole year and the kneading trough require scouring. Rem\"a: Peeling with an artisan's tool does not work. For everything that requires scouring, peeling does not work (Mahar\"i Weil). The practice is not use troughs and boards on which kneading is done the whole year during Passover, even after scouring, and this is the essential position (Mordechai Chapter Kol Sha'ah and Kol Bo), and this was already explained above in chapter 442 paragraph 11.", 
            "The sieve must be checked fully to clean it from the breadcrumbs that stick to it and that stick and cling to the holes in the screen of the sieve and its wood. It should be wiped with water very well. This is true of all of the tools of kneading, that wiping is important. Rem\"a: The practice is not to use a sieve after scouring, and this should not be changed (Mahari\"l and Beit Yosef). This is true of all similar things, like the tool that we call \"rib eizen\" and the pouch for the millstones (Mahari\"l): for all of them, scouring does not work. Also, baskets that are used for hametz are lke sieves. But old bags are treated leniently after washing them. The stitches must be undone before they are washed (Trumat HaDeshen chapter 116).", 
            "Regarding, the shovel that is called \"fila,\" some say that scouring is not sufficient and a new one must be purchased.", 
            "We normally pour boiling water on tables and cupboards in which food is stored during the year, because sometimes soup from the pot spills onto them....", 
            "Clay barrels in which barley beer is stored are permitted through scouring or by pouring for three days. Rem\"a: Scouring the barrels should be done thus: stones should be made white-hot and put inside. Boiling water is poured from a first container. The barrel is rolled such that the scouring gets to every part (Hagahot Maimoni chapter 5). After the fact, if wine or honey was put inside without scouring, but [the barrel] was cleaned well, it is permitted to drink from it on Passover (Mordechai chapter Kol Sha'ah and Hagahot Oshr\"i chapter 2 of Avoda Zara and Trumat HaDeshen in chapter 201).", 
            "All items, even ceramic ones, that were used for cold hametz are permitted to be used for even hot matzo, besides for the yeast or charoset containers. Even though these have only been used for cold hametz, it is forbidden to use them for hot matzah, but it is permitted to put in cold, baked matzah, but it is forbidden to use them to knead. This is all without scouring, but after scouring, even the yeast or charoset containers can be used if they are not ceramic. If they are ceramic, scouring does not work; even if they have only been used for cold hametz, they cannot be used for even cold matzah. Today, the practice is to not use old earthen jars on Passover (meaning old ceramic things). (The winter house-oven is treated like a ceramic object, and it is forbidden to put anything on the oven on Passover) (Mahar\"i Weil).", 
            "Ceramic objects that are coated with glass are treated like ceramic objects. Rem\"a: There are places where the practice is to not use \"lizart\" ceramic things, even new ones (Mahari\"l). Do not be stringent except for in a place where there is such a practice (Responsa of the Mahari\"l)....", 
            "Wooden objects coated in an agent called \"barnis\" are treated like ceramic objects. Rem\"a: There are places that are stringent not to use painted things, even when they are new (Mahari\"l) and also things coated in tin. Do not be stringent in this regard except for in a place where there is a custom to forbid (Responsa of the Mahari\"l).", 
            "All things used for drinking, whether flasks or cups, are permitted after they are washed, whether they are glass, wooden, metal, or ceramic. Even though periodically hot bread is placed in them, because they are usually used for cold things, washing is sufficient, because for every object we follow its usual use. Rem\"a: However, there are those who are stringent and require scouring, and such is the practice (see above in paragraph 6).", 
            "...Glass containers, even if one put [hametz] inside for an extended amount of time, and even if they are used with hot food, do not need any kashering, because they do not absorb. Normal washing is sufficient for them. Rem\"a: There are those who are stringent and say that even scouring does not work for glass objects, and such is the practice in Ashkenaz and in in these lands (Sma\"k and Agur). Silver objects that have glass lining inside called \"gishmaltzt\" should not be scoured, but if it is on the outside, it does not damage [the kosher status of] the object (Trumat HaDeshen chapter 132).", 
            "...If chicken was cooked on a skewer on Passover, [the food is] permitted, even if previously, meat salted with unchecked salt was cooked on it. Rem\"a: However, this should only be permitted after the fact. Similarly, the practice is to clean the faucet in wine barrels (Agur and Mahari\"l). Similarly, wooden sticks that are used to puncture drinking containers need wiping to be put into Passover containers (Mahar\"i Weil)."

            "On the second night after the evening prayer, we begin to count the Omer. And if someone forgot to count, [that one may count] from the beginning of the evening onwards. He may account all night. It is a mitzvah for each person to count for themselves. He needs to count standing and bless before. He should count the days and weeks. How? On the first day he should say “today is day one of the Omer”, until he arrives to seven days. [At which point he should say], “they are one week of the Omer.” And on the eighth day he should say “today is eight days and they are one week and one day of the Omer.” And also, when he arrives to the 14th day, he should say “today is 14 days, they are two weeks of the Omer.” And in this way he should count and onwards until the 49th day.",

However, [if he answered back] before [the period of time] between sunset and when the stars come out [he can go back and count], since it wasn’t the time of the counting of the Omer [which is when it is night time] and it doesn’t count for anything.

However, if he began to eat before the time [to count] arrived, it is not necessary for him to stop except [when] he finishes his eating and counts afterwards.

            "It is customary not to get married between Pesach and Shavuot, until Lag BaOmer (the 33rd day), because during that time, the students of Rabbi Akiva died. However, to do \"erusin\" and \"kiddushin\" (engagement and betrothal) is OK. And even for \"nisuin\" (marriage), if someone did so, we do not punish him. Rema: however, from Lag Ba'Omer onwards, all this is permitted (Abudraham, Beit Yosef &amp; Minhagim).", 
            "It is customary not to cut one's hair until Lag BaOmer, since it is said that that is when they  stopped dying. One should not cut one's hair until the 34th day, in the morning, unless the 33rd day falls on Friday, in which case one may cut one's hair then, in honor of the Sabbath (\"kavod Shabbat\"). Rema: But in these countries, we do not follow the custom he advocates; rather, we cut our hair on the 33rd day, and we rejoice a bit, and we do not say Tachanun (Maharil and Minhagim). And one should only cut one's hair on the 33rd day itself, but not on its evening. However, if it falls on Sunday, our custom is to cut our hair on Friday in honor of the Sabbath (Maharil). Someone who is performing a brit milah (i.e., the sandak, mohel and the infant's father), or circumcizing his son, is allowed to cut his hair during sefirah in honor of the circumcision (Hagahot Minhagim).", 
            "Some have the custom to cut their hair on Rosh Chodesh Iyyar, but this is a mistake. Rema: However, in many places, the custom is to cut their hair until Rosh Chodesh Iyyar, and they do not cut their hair from Lag BaOmer forward, even though it is permitted to cut one's hair on Lag BaOmer itself. But those places who have the custom to cut their hair from Lag BaOmer onwards, do not cut at all after Pesach until Lag BaOmer. And within one city, it should not be that some follow one custom, and some follow another, because of \"lo titgodedu\" (\"do not cut yourselves\" - Deut. 14:1, interpreted in Yevamot 13b as \"lo te'asu agudot agudot,\" \"Do not become seperate groups\"); all the more so, one may not follow both leniencies.", 
            "Women have the custom not to do work from Pesach until Shavu'ot, from sunset onwards."

The women have made it a custom not to do work while the candles are burning. And there is [an opinion] that says that we may not be lenient for them.", 
            "The many meals which we add on [these days] are voluntary meals, since [the Sages] did not establish them as [days of] feasting and joy. Rem\"a: But some say that there is somewhat of a mitzvah in adding meals, because during those days was the Dedication of the Altar (Abraham Kara of Prague). It is the custom to recite hymns and songs of praise during the feasts added on them, and then they are mitzvah meals (Book of Customs). Some say that cheese should be eaten during Hanukkah, because a miracle was done though milk which Yehudit fed the enemy. (Kol Bo and Nissim of Gerona).", 
            "We do not eulogize on [these days], except for a sage in one's presence. Rem\"a: And we do not fast for the day one's father or mother died. And [regarding] a fast for a dream on Hanukkah, see above Section 568 Paragraph 5. As regards the Justification of [Divine] Judgment [prayer], see above in the Laws of the New Moon, Section 420 in Rem\"a. And see below, Section 683."

            "One needs to be very diligent in kindling the Hanukkah lights. Even a poor man living off charity must lend or sell his clothes, and buy oil to kindle with.", 
            "How many lights should one kindle? On the first night, he kindles one [light]. From then on he continues to add one each night, until on the last night they are eight. And even if the household members are many, they should not kindle more. Rem\"a: And some say that every one of the household members kindles (Maimonides) and such is the widespread custom. And they should take care to each place their lights in a unique place, so that it will be apparent how many lights they are kindling. (Abraham Kara of Prague)", 
            "An [oil] light with two outlets [for the wicks] counts for [the kindler] as two.",

[If] he did not cover it with a vessel, it does not even count as one light, because it is like a bonfire.Rem\"a: Therefore one should be careful to place the lights in a straight row and not in a circle, since that is like a bonfire. (Hagahot Maimoniot quoting Sefer Mitzvot Katan) It is permitted to kindle with candlesticks, since each light is separated greatly from the other. (Terumat Hadeshen Section 105) One must be careful when preparing lights, even of wax, not to stick them together and kindle them, since that is like a bonfire. (Piskei Mahar\"i 65) Even with the lights of the Sabbath and Holy Days one must be careful not to do so. (Or Zarua)", 
            "One should place the Hanukkah light at the entrance which adjoins the public domain, on the outside. If the house opens to the public domain, he should place it at its entrance. If there is a courtyard in front of the house, he should place it at the entrance of the courtyard. If he lives in the upper floor, having no entrance leading to the public domain, he should place it at a window that adjoins the public domain. In a time of danger, when one is not allowed to perform mitzvot, it is enough that he place it on his table. He needs another light to use for its illumination. And if there is a bonfire, he needs no other light. But if he is a dignified person, whose way is not to use the illumination of a bonfire, he needs another light.", 
            "One should place [the Hanukkah light] above three handsbreadths [from the ground]. It is a mitzvah to place it beneath ten handsbreadths. But if he placed it above ten handsbreadths, he has fulfilled his obligation. However, if he placed it above twenty cubits, he has not fulfilled his obligation. Rem\"a: And even if he took it as it is, lit, and placed it below twenty cubits, he has not fulfilled his obligation, because the kindling accomplishes the mitzvah. (Beit Yosef quoting Tosafot)", 
            "It is a mitzvah to place [the Hanukkah light] in the handsbreadth closest to the entrance on the left, so as to have the mezuzah on the right and the Hanukkah light on the left. But if there is no mezuzah in the entrance, he should place [the Hanukkah light] on the right. If one places it in the doorway itself, he should place it on the leftmost half of the entrance. <i> Rem\"a: However nowadays, when all kindle inside, and there is no distinction for the people of the public domain at all, one should not worry so much if we do not kindle it in the handsbreadth closest to the entrance. In any case, the custom is to kindle it in the handsbreadth closest to the entrance, as in [our ancestors'] days, and one should not deviate; unless the household members are many, [in which case] it is preferable for each one to kindle in a unique place rather than mixing the lights together, with no distinction of the number of lights they are kindling. In any case, they should take care not to kindle in the same place where they kindle lights all year, since then there would be no distinction at all. And even though there is only no distinction except for the members of the household, some distinction at least is necessary.</i> In the synagogue, one should place [the Hanukkah light] at the southern wall (or to the south of the lamp, and he should arrange them from east to west). (Terumat Hadeshen Section 104, Beit Yosef) We kindle and recite the benedictions (in the synagogue) for the sake of publicizing the miracle. <i> Rem\"a: A person does not fulfill his obligation with the lights of the synagogue, and needs to kindle again in his own house. (Isaac ben Sheshet Section 111) We have the custom to kindle in the synagogue between the afternoon prayer and the evening prayer. Some have the custom to kindle on the Sabbath Eve before the afternoon prayer. (Kol Bo and Book of Abudirham) If [the prayer leader] wants to quickly pray right away after [he] has recited the benedictions and kindled one of them, the synagogue attendant may kindle the rest, and the prayer leader may pray. (Jacob ben Moses Moelin) </i>", 
            "A courtyard having two entrances on two sides, [the owner] needs to kindle [Hanukkah lights] at both, because of suspicion [that he did not light]. But if both entrances are on the same side (and belong to the same house) (Kol Bo), one of them is enough for him. Rem\"a: When one kindles at two entrances, he only recites the benedictions by one of them, and kindles the second without a benediction (Nissim of Gerona). However, nowadays, when all kindle actually inside and there is no distinction for the people of the public domain at all, even if a courtyard or house has many entrances on many sides, we kindle only once inside; so it seems to me and so is the widespread custom."
