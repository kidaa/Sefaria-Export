Rashi on Ezekiel

Chapter 1



Verse 1

"And it was in the 30th year." The prophet's words are obscure and he did not state his name [i.e.] who he is, and he did not explain from when he is counting [30 years]. For this reason, the holy spirit stopped his words in the two verses following this one, to teach who the prophet is and from when he is counting. For when it says, "on the fifth day of the month in the fifth year etc." these are not the words of the prophet, for he already said that on the fifth day of the month he was standing etc. Moreover, from the first he spoke his prophecy in the first person, "I was in the exile and I saw visions of God" and also at the end [he says] "and I saw and, behold, a storm wind etc." And these two verses that stop his words, are as if another person is speaking about him, "the word of the Lord was to Ezekiel and there the hand of God was upon him."
"And I was in the Exile." That is to say, outside of the Land of Israel.
"By the river Kebar." The name of the river.
"Visions of God." Because he did not see in an illuminating vision he calls it "visions of God," a kind of dream and not [an] actual [vision]. And all the prophets too saw in a non-illuminating vision except for Moses our teacher, as it is written, "and by the hand of the prophets I [made] a likeness" (Hosea Chapter 12, v. 11)

Verse 2

"That was [in] the fifth year from the exile of Jehoiachin." We learn [from this] that the thirty years were counted from the start of the Jubilee. For the last Jubiliee started in the beginning of the 18th year of [King] Hosiah, the year that [the high priest] Hilkiah found the book [in the Temple] (2 Kings 22.8), and thus we learned in [the book] Seder Olam [Rabbah] that [that year] was the beginning of the Jubilee.  Hoseah reigned for 31 years, subtract 17 years that already passed, 14 years are left. Jehoiakim reigned 11 years, equals 25 [years], and Jeconiah his son only ruled 3 months and was exiled. And the year Ezekiel prophesied was the fifth year from his [i.e. Jeconiah's] exile, so that was the 30th year from the Jubilee.  Thus we found at the end of his prophecy that he gave a sign for the counting of the Jubilee, as it is written, "and it was in the 25th year of our exile in the beginning of the year [Rosh Hashana] on the tenth day of the month (Ch. 40 v. 1 [typo in Hebrew, should be Mem(=40), not Bet]). And our Rabbis said, "what year is it that Rosh Hashana is on the 10th of the month, the answer is the year of the Jubilee."

Verse 3

Our Rabbis said it was [by the river] Chebar because the Shekhina does not rest on a prophet outside of the Land [of Israel] unless on account of it rested on him first [while he was] in the Land. And we learned in the bareita of Mechilta [that the verse] "Son of Man stand up on your legs" [Ch 2 v. 1 (error in Hebrew, should be Bet, not Yod Bet)] was the beginning of the book for [according to the principle] there is no earlier or later [in the Torah]. And some say "Son of Man, make a riddle" (Ch. 17 v. 2) was the beginning of the book. But I say that that prophecy [i.e. Ch 2 v. 1] was given him before they were exiled because it is an appropriate prophecy to be spoken to him in the Land [of Israel]. For the exile is not stated in it, and it stands out as the beginning of his being sent to them [i.e. the people]. And Yonatan translated [our present verse] this way too, "The word of prophecy came from God to Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest in the Land of Israel, and a second time returned and spoke with him in the country of the land of the Chaldeans, and Ezekiel was exiled with the skilled workers and artisans with Jehoiachin" [see 2 Kings 24.14].
Every time the term "hand" is used in this book or in prophetic language it means none other than force, that the prophecy forces itself [upon him] against his will, like a man who has gone crazy, Distritse in German/French.

Verse 4

AND A STORM WIND CAME FROM THE NORTH. This is the chariot seat, the glory of the divine presence [shekhina], as it is written on the matter [i.e. below]. And because it [the wind] comes in wrath to destory Israel it is compared to a storm wind and cloud.
CAME FROM THE NORTH. It was returning from the land of the Chaldeans, which is in the north, as it is written, "from the north evil will open up" (Jeremiah 1.14). And why did it go there? In order to conquer the whole world under Nebuchadnezzar, lest the Babylonians say He handed over his sons [i.e. Israel] into the hand of a lowly people. For the Chaldeans were a lowly people, as it is written, "This people that were not" (Isaiah 23.13). Thus interpreted our Rabbis in Masechet Hagigah.
AND IT SHINED FORTH. [This is] regarding the cloud, round about it, on the outside. This is a clue that Israel are destined to be redeemed from this quarter.
LIKE HASHMAL. Hashmal is an angel who is so called. And he [Ezekiel] saw a kind of color like [the color] of him inside the fire. And thus our Rabbis said, [about] a story of a baby who used to seek after the doings of the [divine] chariot, and understood regarding Hashmal, and a fire came from Hashmal and destroyed him. And they further said the word is assembled, for they said "why Hashmal? Rabbi Yehuda said, "animals of fire speaking" [=Hebrew letters het, shin, mem, lamed, =Hashmal]. In the Mishna he learns, sometimes they are quiet, and sometimes they speak. At the time the spoken word comes forth from the Holy One Blessed Be He they are quiet, at the time when there is no spoken word from the Holy One Blessed Be He they speak, that is they praise and glorify God. And it is likely that Hashmal is the name of the eye, that is similar to the eye of a flame, for it says, "Hashmal from inside the fire" [1.4] and it says, "like [like=ke'ein, which can also mean "like the eye" ("ein"="like" or "eye")] Hashmal, like [ke'ein] the appearance of fire framing it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upwards" [1.27] and it says in the second vision, "from his loins upwards like [ke'ein] the appearance of radiance like [ke'ein] Hashmal" [8.2].  

Verse 5

AND FROM INSIDE [THE FIRE]. Referring to the same fire, I saw as if Hashmal visible from inside the fire. It is not known what it [Hashmal] is. And the Midrash according to which the Rabbis interpreted it is "animals of fire speaking" [het, shin, mem, lamed=Hashmal] [but] this is not based on the matter [i.e. is not grounded in the text].
THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A HUMAN. One is surprised [by this statement], for they also have the likeness of an ox, a lion, and an eagle. And it seems to me [that it is] because [a human] is father to the rest, the prophet glorified the [divine] chariot this way [i.e. by saying the animals had the appearance of humans]. And it was the likeness of Jacob our father's face.

Verse 6

AND EACH [OF THEM] HAD FOUR FACES. "Each" refers to the human face ['parzuf'] specifically, [which] had four faces [or aspects, 'panim'], and so [too] the lion and the eagle and the ox [had four faces/aspects each]. So in total there were 16 [faces/aspects ('panim')] to the creature, and so it was for each one. And each face had 4 wings, so in total there were 64 wings for each creature. And thus Jonathan translated [to Aramaic], "256 wings." 

Verse 7

[AND THEIR LEGS WERE (THE SHAPE OF) A] STRAIGHT LEG. Legs directed one opposite the other. Also, "straight," they don't have spring-joints to bend their thighs, for they do not sit or lie down, and they do not need to possess springing joints like animals have an upper spring-joint and a lower spring-joint, which they use to bend their thighs and lie down.
A CALF'S LEG. A round leg (or foot), and thus Jonathan translated, "round legs."
AND GLEAMED. Due to their gleaming, it was as if sparks came out of them, as we said in Tractate Yoma, "and she made a chandelier of gold etc. [and] when the sun shines [on it] sparks [appear to] come out of it etc."
LIKE [BRONZE]. Similar too, with the appearance of.
BURNISHED BRONZE. Purified and illuminating, and comforting its counterpart if roasted in the fire (Leviticus Ch. 3 [which discusses sacrificing a calf as a peace offering, see v. 1-5]). [N.B. another edition of Rashi says, "see Leviticus 2.14" (which discusses roasting a grain offering in the fire)].
