Torah 1

Happy are the ones on the wholehearted path, who walk in HaShem's Torah. (Psalms 119:1)
Acknowledge because by way of the Torah all prayers and requests  that we request and and pray are accepted.  And Yisrael's favor and importance are raised and elevated before whoever they need whether spiritually or materialistically.  Because now in our many transgressions Yisrael's real favor and importance descended, because now the importance and favor are mainly by them, but through the Torah Yisrael's favor and importance are raised because the Torah is called (Proverbs 5) AYeLeT AHaVIM VYAALaT HeN/Favor, that raises/SHeiMAALaH HeN/favor upon her studiers (Eruvin 54b); through this all prayers and requests are raised.

Torah 6

"And the LORD said to Moses... call Joshua..." (Deuteronomy 31:14)
1) Such that every man needs to minimize his honor and to maximize the honor of the place(the LORD). Since one that pursues after honor does not attain "the honor of Elokim", but rather the "honor of kings" as it says, "the honor of kings is to investigate a matter", and everyone investigates after him and they ask, "who is this one, and what of him that he divides to himself this honor", and they oppose on him, such that they say that he is not worthy for this honor.

Torah 282

Know, that it is necessary to judge every person as meritorious. Even if someone is entirely wicked, it is necessary to search and find in him some bit of good, that in that bit he is not wicked, and by means of this, that you find in him a bit of good, and judge him as meritorious, by means of this you raise him in truth to the side of merit, and you can return him in repentance. This is "a little bit and there is no wicked, you will contemplate on his place and he isn't there" (Psalms 37:10), that is, the verse warns to judge everyone as meritorious, and even though you see the he is completely wicked, even so, you must search and quest to find in him a bit of good where he isn't wicked.  This is "a little bit and there is no wicked" - you have to search out in him a bit of good that is still there, where he is not wicked, because even though he is wicked, how is it possible that there isn't still a bit of good, because how is possible that he didn't do a mitzvah or a good thing his whole life?  By means of this that you find in him a bit of good where he is not wicked, and you judge him as meritorious, by means of this you raise him in truth from the side of liability to the side of merit, until he returns in repentance by means of his.  This is "a little bit and there is no wicked", by means of finding in the wicked a bit of good, where he isn't wicked "you will contemplate on his place and he isn't there", meaning when you contemplate and look at his place and level, he isn't there, in his original place, because by means of finding in him a bit of good, a good point, and judging him as meritorious, by means of this you truly take him from the side of liability to the side of merit.  This is "you will contemplate on his place and he isn't there".  Understand this well. [...]
