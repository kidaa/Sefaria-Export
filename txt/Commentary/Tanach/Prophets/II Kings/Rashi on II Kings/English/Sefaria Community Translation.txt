Verse 4

And you shall close the door: It affords respect to the miracle if it comes about in secret. 
from before you, and you shall place another vessel in its place to fill it, but the jug of oil you shall not move from its place, for the Holy One, Blessed be He, is making it as a spring, and it is not customary for a spring to move from its place. I heard this Midrash Aggadah

Verse 6

and the oil stopped: coming any more. [This is the] peshat. Mid. Aggadah in Gen. Rabbah 35 explains it literally: and the oil stood up, meaning that the price of oil went. up

Verse 7

<b>"Do not deceive:</b> Do not show me something that will be interrupted: You have in your power to request mercy and a son will be given to me. However I plead from you, "Only give me a son that has durable existence."  

Verse 17

<b>As at this time she is alive:</b> [Meaning] as at that time that she had been living and in peace. And for this reason, it is vocalized [with a <i>patach</i> that takes the place of a definitive letter, <i>hay</i>, and indicates a specific time].

<b>"Do not greet him:"</b> Do not inquire about his wellbeing. And all of this, so that he not [speak] much [so that] they would ask him, "Where are you going?" And [then] he would answer, "To revive the dead." And  this bringing praise to the one through which the miracle happens is not [considered] honor to the miracle. And he did not do this, but rather to anyone who would ask, he would say, "My master sent me to revive the dead." (Tanchuma, Besalach 26, Talmud Yerushalmi, 10:2)

And he will withdraw from you and return to his land. [He will] not [return] because of the rumor, but after awhile he will return shamefacedly, and I will cause him to fall there by the sword. Now what was the rumor? (v. 9) “And he heard [a rumor] about Tirhakah.” He heard that Tirhakah had gone out to wage war against him. Consequently, he withdrew from Jerusalem and went to Cush, and waged war with Tirhakah, Put and Egypt, who were with him. He defeated him and took their most coveted treasures, and came to Jerusalem, where he fell. In reference to this, Isaiah stated (Is. 45:14), “The toil of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush… will pass by you….”

his treasure-house: [Heb. בֵּית נְכֹתוֹ] the storehouse of his spices, like (Gen. 37:25) “spices (נְכֹאת) , balm and lotus.”
 and the good oil: Some interpret this as the anointing oil (Ex. 30:22 33), and others interpret it as balsam oil, which is found in Eretz Israel, as it is said (Ezek. 27: 17), “Judah and the land of Israel, they were your merchants, with wheat of Minnith and Pannag.” 
I saw in the book of Josephon (book 4, ch. 22), Pannag is balsam, and it grows in Jericho. Because of the aroma (רֵיחַ), it is called Jericho (יְרִיחוֹ).
 there was nothing: Even the Ark, the Tablets, and the Scroll of the Law.

However,… would not go up: The priests who burnt incense on the high places to idots, may not ascend anymore to serve on the altar of the Lord.
 	
they would eat unleavened cakes: meal-offerings, and likewise, all hallowed things.

Verse 10


the Tofeth: This was the Molech. Since priests would bang on drums so that the father would not hear the groans of the child when he would be burned by the hands of the pagan image, Molech, they called it Topheth.

  Jonathan rendered: the craftsmen and the sentries of the gates, [translating harash as craftsmen, as in Ex. 28:11, and masger as closing, i.e., those who close the gates.] Our Rabbis, however, said that these were great Torah scholars, that when one would open his mouth to speak, all would remain silent, as it is written (Is. 41:1), “Keep silence  before Me, O islands.” “Masger,” all would sit before him and learn from him, as it is said (Is. 22:22), “And he will open, and no one will close, and he will close, and no one will open.”

Verse 15

and the dignitaries of the land: These are the dignitaries of Judah and Benjamin, who were righteous men. Concerning them the Scripture states (Jer. 24:5), “Like these good figs, so will I recognize the exiles of Judah.” (Copied from Chabad.org, same with the Rashis from pasuk 11 and 14)

Therefore, Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylonia. The Holy One, Blessed be He, gave [the desire] into his heart to rebel against him in order that he(Zedekiah) would be exiled.
