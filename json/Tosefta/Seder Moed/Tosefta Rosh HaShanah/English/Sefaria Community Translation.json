            "<i>Nisan</i> is the beginning of the year for kings and for [the three pilgrimage] festivals and for months and for the collection of shekels and there are those who say even for home rentals. How is it the beginning for kings? If a king dies in <i>Adar</i> and they appoint a successor while it is still <i>Adar</i>, a year of reigning is counted for the former king and the current one.  [Similarly], if a king dies in <i>Nisan</i> and they appoint a successor while it is still <i>Nisan</i> a year [of reigning] is counted for the former king and the current one. [However], if a king dies in <i>Adar</i> and they appoint a successor only in <i>Nisan</i>, the first year is counted for the first king and the second is counted for the second king."
