            "On the evening of the fourteenth [of Nissan] we check for <i>chamets</i> [leavened grain products] by candlelight. Any place into which we do not bring <i>chamets</i> does not require checking. And why did [the Sages] say [that we must check up to] two rows in the wine cellar? [It is] a place which we bring leavened bread into. Beit Shammai says, \"Two rows upon the entire wine-cellar.\" But Beit Hillel says, \"The two outer rows, which are the uppermost.\"", 
            "We do not need to be concerned [that] perhaps a weasel dragged [<i>chamets</i>] from [one] house to [another] house, or from [one] place to [another] place. Since if [we were to be concerned, we would also need to be concerned that <i>chamets</i> was dragged] from [one] courtyard to [another] courtyard, and from [one] city to [another] city — there [would be] no end to the matter.", 
            "Rabbi Yehuda says, \"We check on the evening of the fourteenth, and on the fourteenth in the morning, and at the time of the destruction [of <i>chamets</i>].\" And the Sages say, \"If he did not check on the evening of the fourteenth, he must check on the [day of the] fourteenth. If he did not check on the fourteenth, he must check on [the intermediate days of] the festival. If he did not check on the festival, he must check after the festival.\" And what he leaves over [on the night of the fourteenth in order to eat on the morrow], he must put in a concealed place, in order that checking after it shall not be necessary.", 
            "Rabbi Meir says, \"We may eat [<i>chamets</i>] through all [the first] five [hours of the day], and we must burn [it] at the beginning of the sixth [hour].\" Rabbi Yehuda says, \"We may eat [it] through all [the first] four [hours of the day], we hold [it] in suspense through the fifth [hour], and we must burn it at the beginning of the sixth [hour].\"", 
            "Rabbi Yehudah also said, \"Two loaves of bread of a thank-offering [that had become] unfit were placed on the roof of the [Temple] portico. As long as they [both] lay [there], all the people would eat [<i>chamets</i>]. [When] one of them was removed, they would suspend and neither eat nor burn [their <i>chamets</i>]. [When] the second one of them was removed, all the people would begin burning [their <i>chamets</i>].\" Rabban Gamliel says, \"[<i>Chamets</i> that is] <i>chulin</i> [ food permitted for general consumption] may be eaten through all [the first] four [hours of the day]; but [<i>chamets</i> that is]  <i>terumah</i> [may be eaten even] through all [the first] five [hours of the day]; and we must burn [all <i>chamets</i>] at the beginning of the sixth [hour].\"", 
            "Rabbi Chanina, the adjunct head of the <i>Kohanim</i> [the priestly caste, a subgroup of tribe of Levi, which is uniquely responsible for maintaining and carrying out the sacrificial services in the Temple], said, \"During [all] the days of the <i>Kohanim</i>, they never refrained from burning [sacrificial] meat that had become impure by a secondary source of impurity [along] with [sacrificial] meat that had become impure by a primary source of impurity, even though it added impurity to impurity.\"  Rabbi Akiva added and said, \"During [all] the days of the <i>Kohanim</i>, they never refrained from lighting oil that had become unfit by [contact with] a <i>tevul yom</i> [a person who has immersed that day for purification but who must wait for night-fall to be fully pure] in a lamp that had become impure by one who had become impure by a corpse, even though they would [by so doing] add impurity to impurity.\"", 
            "Said Rabbi Meir, \"From their words we learn that we may burn <i> terumah</i> that is pure [but is <i>chamets</i>, together] with [<i> terumah</i>] that is impure on Pesach.\"  Rabbi Yose said to him, \"This is not analogous.  [Even] Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua concede that each is burned separately.  About what do they disagree?  About [<i>terumah</i> whose status of purity was] in question and impure [<i>terumah</i>], where Rabbi Eliezer says, 'Each must be burned separately;' and Rabbi Yehoshua says, 'Both [of them may be burned] together.'\""

[After the] time [that it may still be eaten] has passed, it is prohibited to benefit from it, and one may not feed the fire of an oven or a pot range with it.

Rabbi Eliezer says, \"One should not give it a name [to consider it as <i>challah</i>] until after it has been baked;\" Rabbi Yehuda ben Betera says, \"One should take it [to separate it] in cold [water];\" Rabbi Yehoshuah says, \"This is not the <i>chamets</i> that we are admonished about with [the prohibition of], '[it] shall not be seen and [it] shall not be found;' rather one separates it and leaves it until the evening, and if it becomes leavened, it becomes leavened [and he need not be concerned].",

[If one is walking to go and] save [people] from armed foes, or from the [flooding of a] river, or from robbers, or from fire, or from the collapse of ruined buildings, he must annul [the <i>chamets</i>] in his heart; and if [he is walking to go and] set up his optional Shabbat rest [so as to allow for himself a different area within which he may walk on Shabbat], he must return immediately [to destroy his <i>chamets</i>.",

And if the son has insufficient understanding [to question], his father teaches him [to ask]:  Why is this night different from all [other] nights?  On all [other] nights, we eat leavened and unleavened bread, [but] on this night, [we eat] only unleavened bread.  On all [other] nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, [but] on this night, [we eat only] bitter herbs.  On all [other] nights, we eat meat roasted, stewed or boiled, [but] on this night, [we eat] only roasted [meat].  On all [other] nights, we dip [vegetables] once, [but] on this night, we dip [vegetables] twice.  And according to the son's intelligence, his father instructs him.  He begins [answering the questions] with [the account of Israel’s] shame and concludes with [Israel’s] glory, and expounds from “My father was a wandering Aramean” until he completes the whole passage.", 
            "Rabban Gamliel used to say: Whoever does not mentioned these three things on Passover does not discharge his duty, and these are they: the Passover-offering, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. [The] Passover-offering [is offered] because the Omnipresent One passed over the houses of our ancestors in Egypt. Unleavened bread [is eaten] because our ancestors were redeemed from Egypt. [The] bitter herb is [eaten] because the Egyptians embittered the lives of our ancestors in Egypt.  In every generation a person must regard himself as though he personally had gone out of Egypt, as it is said: “And you shall tell your son in that day, saying: ‘It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.’” Therefore it is our duty to thank, praise, laud, glorify, exalt, honor, bless, extol, and adore Him Who performed all these miracles for our ancestors and us; He brought us forth from bondage into freedom, from sorrow into joy, from mourning into festivity, from darkness into great light, and from servitude into redemption. Therefore let us say before Him, Hallelujah!", 
            "Up until which point should he recite?  The House of Shammai says: Up to 'as a happy mother of children'.  The House of Hillel says: Up to 'flint stone into a water-spring', and conclude with the blessing of redemption.  Rabbi Tarfon says: 'who redeemed us and our ancestors from Egypt', but without a concluding blessing.  Rabbi Akiva says: 'O YHVH our God and God of our ancestors--may we come to reach other seasons and festivals in peace, joyful in the rebuilding of your city, and jubilant in your Temple service, where we will eat from the offerings and Passover sacrifices etc.' until 'Bless you YHVH, Redeemer of Israel.", 
            "They mix a third cup; he blesses his meal. [The] fourth [cup] is concluded with Hallel, which he says with the [concluding] blessing.  Between these cups, if he wishes to drink, he may drink.  Between the third and the fourth [cups], he may not drink.", 
            "They may not add an afikoman after the Pesach offering.  If a few of them changed [locations], they may eat.  If all of them [changed locations], they may not eat.  Rabbi Yossi says:  if they nod off, they may eat. If they fall asleep, they may not eat.", 
            "[Contact with] the Pesach sacrifice after midnight renders one's hands impure.  [Contact with] <i>piggul</i> [a sacrifice that becomes unfit, due to the intention of the officiating priest, while offering it, to consume it after its permitted time] or <i>notar</i> [a sacrifice that becomes unfit, due to being left unconsumed until after the time limit for its consumption] renders one's hands impure.  [If] one recited a blessing over the Pesach sacrifice, he exempts [himself from the obligation to make a blessing] on [another] sacrifice [that he eats].  If he recited a blessing over [the eating of another] sacrifice, he has not exempted [himself from the obligation to make a blessing] on the Pesach sacrifice - so says Rabbi Yishmael.  Rabbi Akiva says, \"Neither this nor that [blessing] exempts the other.\""
