            "From when do we read Shema in the evenings? “From the time when people come [home] to eat their bread on Shabbat (Sabbath) nights,” [these are] the words of Rebbi Meir. And the Chachamim (Sages) say from the time when the Kohanim (priests) are able to eat their Terumah (heave offering). A sign for this is the coming out of the stars. And even though there is no explicit proof for this matter, there is an indirect reference: “… and half of them were holding spears from the morning twilight until the coming out of the stars.” (Nehemiah 4:15)", 
            "Rebbi Shimon says, “Sometimes a person may read it (i.e. The Shema) two times in one night, once before dawn and once after dawn. [And if that happens] it comes out that he fulfills his obligation for the day [reading] and for the night [reading].”...", 
            "Rebbi says, “There are four watches in a night. [There is a unit of time called] time period (Onah) which is 1/24th of an hour. And [there is another unit of time called] the time (Et) which is 1/24th of the time period (Onah). And [there is a third unit of time called] the moment (Regah) which is 1/24th of the time (Et).” Rebbi Natan says, “There are three watches in a night, as it is said ‘… the beginning of the middle watch.’ (Judges 7:19) There is no [such thing as a] middle, but only when there is something before it and after it.”", 
            "From when do we read the Shema in the morning? Acherim (Others) say, “[from the time] when his friend will be four amot away from him and he recognizes him.” The mitzvah [to say it] is with sunrise in order to connect redemption (Geulah) to prayer (Tefillah), and it will come out that he will pray during the day. Rebbi Yehudah said, “One time I was walking behind Rebbi Akiva and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah and the time came to read the Shema. I supposed they gave up on reading the Shema [right away] because they were busy with the needs of the community. I read [the Shema] and [then] learned [some Torah] and after that they began [reading the Shema], and the sun could already be seen above the mountain tops.”", 
            "The grooms and all [others] who are involved in [other] Mitzvot (commandments) are exempt from reading [the] Shema as it is said, “… when you sit in your house”, (Deuteronomy 6:7) [meaning] except for those who are involved in mitzvot, “and when you walk on the way”, (Deuteronomy 6:7) [meaning] except for the grooms.", 
            "It happened with Rebbi Yishmael and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah that they were resting in the same place and Rebbi Yishmael was laying down and Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah was [standing up] straight. It came time to say Shema. Rebbi Yishmael stood up straight and Rebbi Elazar laid down. Said to him Rebbi Yishmael: “What is this Elazar?” He said [back] to him: “Yishmael, my brother! They say to a person, ‘Why is your beard all grown [so nice]?’ He said [back to them], ‘[it should be sent] against the destroyers’ (i.e. cut off by the scissors). [So too with us] I (Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah) who was straight, laid down, you that was laying down, stood up straight?” [So Rebbi Yishmael] said to him: “You laid down to fulfill the words of Bet Shamai, I stood up straight to fulfill the words of Bet Hillel. A different explanation, that the students should not see [that you did like Bet Shamai] and make your words [a] permanent [law].", 
            "Why did they say one short [Beracha (blessing)]? In the place where they said to be long, one is not allowed to be short, [and in the place where they said] to be short, one is not allowed to be long. [In the place where they said] to seal off [the Beracha], one is not allowed not to seal off, [in the place where they said] not to seal off [the Beracha], one is not allowed to seal off. [In the place where they said] to begin [the Beracha] with [the word] Baruch (Blessed), one is not allowed not to begin with Baruch, [in the place where they said] not to begin [the Beracha] with Baruch, one is not allowed to begin with Baruch. [In the place where they said] to bend down, one is not allowed not to bend down , [and in the place where they said] not to bend down, one is not allowed to bend down.", 
            "These are the Berachot (blessings) which are [coined to be] short: One who blesses on fruit, and on mitzvot, the Beracha (blessing) of Zimun, and the last Beracha of Shema. These are the Berachot which are [coined to be] long: the Beracha of Fast Days, and the Beracha of Rosh Hashana, and the Berachot of Yom Kippur. From [the way] a person [says] his Berachot it is recognizable if he a fool or if he is a sage.", 
            "These are the Berachot (blessings) which do not seal off with [the phrase] Baruch [Ata Hashem] (Blessed are You Hashem): One that blesses on the fruit, and on the mitzvot, Birkat Hazimun, and the last Beracha in Birkat Hamazon. Rebbi Yossi Hagelili used to seal off the last Beracha in Birkat Hamazon and [therefore] make it long."

            "One who says the Shema must remember the exodus from Egypt when saying \"Emet V'Yatziv\". Rabbi [Yehuda] says that one must remember the [Davidic] kingship. Aherim say that one  must remember the slaying of the first born and the dividing of the Red Sea. "

            "A person should not taste anything until he makes a Beracha (blessing) [on it], as it is said, “To Hashem is the Earth and its fullness…” (Psalms 24:1) [A person] who receives pleasure from this world without a Beracha makes inappropriate use of sacred property, until all of the Mitzvot (commandments) [that must be done over this object] will permit it to him. A person should use his face, his hands and his feet only for the honor of his Creator, as it is said, “Every creation of Hashem is for His sake.” (Proverbs 16:4)", 
            "The Beracha (blessing) that is made on date honey, apple cider and vinegar made from autumn grapes is the same as the Beracha made on fish brine.", 
            "The Beracha (blessing) for undiluted wine is Borei Pri Haetz (Who created the fruit of the tree) and it (i.e. undiluted wine) can be used to wash hands. [If] he added water into it, [then] the Beracha on it [becomes] Borei Pri Hagafen (Who created the fruit of the vine) and it (i.e. diluted wine) cannot be used to wash hands. [These are] the words of Rebbi Eliezer. And the Chachamim (Sages) say, “Whether this one (i.e. undiluted wine) or that one (i.e. diluted wine), the Beracha on it is Borei Pri Hagafen and it cannot be used to wash hands.”"
