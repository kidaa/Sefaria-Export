Verse 1



Verse 2

"And take to you" - [This means "bring".] Like (Genesis 48:9), "Take them to me", (Numbers 23:27) "I will take you to another place", (I Samuel 20:31) "Send and take him to me."
"Perfect, without blemish in it" - The language is repetitious, like (Leviticus 22:21) "It must be perfect to be acceptable, it should have no blemish in it."

Verse 11

"And it shall be impure seven days" - The opinion of Abraham Ibn Ezra that this is past tense, is void. For if seven days had already passed, it could no longer say that he will sin on the third day.
