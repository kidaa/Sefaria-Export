                "It should have written \"and he (G-d) will return\" (with a hay, not just shin beis) Our Rabbis learn from here as if it were possible that the shechinah rests with Israel (the Jews) in (the time of) the hardship of their exile.  And when (the Jews) are redeemed, (Hashem had) redemption written about himself, that he would return with them. Furthermore, it can be said, that the day of gathering the exiled is so great and difficult, it as if He himself must actually hold each and every person with his hands to take him from his place (in exile). (this is) like the matter which is said (in the verse): \"and you shall be gathered, one by one, Children of Israel.\" And also regarding the exiles of other nations, we have found this (for example) \"And i will return the captivity of Egypt\""
