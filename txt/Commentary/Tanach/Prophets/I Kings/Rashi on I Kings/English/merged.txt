Rashi on I Kings

Chapter 1



Verse 1

And it did not warm him- Our Rabbis said, "All who scorn clothing do not benefit from them in the end (Berakhot 62b 30-31)"- because he ripped of the corner of Saul's coat [he could not become warm through clothes]. And in the Midrash Agadah [it says]: Rav Shmuel the son of Nakhmani said, "When David saw the angel standing in Jerusalem with his sword in hand, his blood went cold from fear (See Pirkei d'Rabbi Eliezer 43)".
