Mishneh Torah, Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav

Chapter 1

It is a biblical commandment to hear the sound of the shofar on Rosh Hashannah as it says "it is a day of blowing the horn unto you." The horn which is blown, both on Rosh Hashannah and for the Jubilee year, is a bent ram's horn. All Shofars are invalid except the horn of a ram. Even though a Shofar is not mentioned explicitly in the passage about Rosh Hashannah, it does say in the passage about the Jubilee year "Then shalt thou make proclamation with the blast of the Shofar" and we have learned through the Tradition that just as the "teruah" of the Jubilee year is with a shofar, so is the "teruah" of Rosh Hashannah.
In the Mikdash they would blow on Rosh Hashana with one Shofar, and two trumpets, from the sides. The shofar would blow for longer, and the trumpets would blow shorter, because the Mitzvah of the day is with [the] shofar. And why would they blow trumpets with it? For it says "With trumpets and sound of the horn Shout ye before the King, the lord" (Psalms 98:6). But in other places (outside of the Mikdash) [we] do not blow on Rosh Hashana, rather with a shofar alone.

Chapter 5

The covering of the sukkah is not kosher from all materials.  One may cover only with materials that grew from the earth, that was uprooted from the earth and that is not susceptible to ritual impurity (tumah) and does not have a bad smell nor has fallen or is wilted.

Chapter 8











[If] partners who bought a lulav or Etrog together, neither of them can fulfill the Mitzva on the first day until the other gives him his portion as a gift. [If] brothers bought multiple Etrogs [with money from a shared] estate and one [brother] took one [etrog] on the first day, he has fulfilled [his obligation]. However if they keep accounts [of the estate money] he has not fulfilled his obligation until the other [brother] gives it to him as a gift. And even if one bought an Etrog and the other a quince or one bought an etrog, a quince, and a pomegranate he has not discharged [his obligation] until the other [brother] gives him his share [in the fruit] even if he would not mind [under normal circumstances] if [the first brother] ate it.
...Although it is a Mitzvah  to rejoice on all festivals, on the Sukkot holiday there was a time of overabundant joy in the Holy Temple, for it is written, "...you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days." And how was this done? On the eve of the first holiday they would arrange in the Holy Temple a place for the women above and for the men below so that they might not mix one with the other. And they began to rejoice from the night after the first holiday, and continued on each and every day of the intercessory days of the holiday. They began after the Tamid offering was made in the evening to rejoice unto the rest of the day and through the night.
...And how was this joy [performed]? The flute was struck and the violin, harps, and cymbals, were played, and every person played any instrument he knew how to play. And those who knew to sing, sang. And they danced, and clapped their hands and thighs, and spun, and crowed, each according to their ability, and spoke words of praise and song. And this joy does not supercede the Sabbath or the Holy Day.
It is an obligation to indulge in this merriment. This was not done by the folk of the land or whoever so wished, but by the greatest sages of Israel and the heads of the Yeshivot and the sanhedrin and the pious ones and the elders and the men of virtuous deeds, they were the ones who danced and clapped and played instruments and rejoiced during the days of Sukkot. But the entire People, the men and the women, all would come to look and to listen.
The joy that a person should express in performing the Commandment[s] and in the love of God who commanded them, is a great worship [to God]. Whoever avoids expressing this joy is worthy of being punished for it, as it is stated: "...in return for you not worshipping the LORD your God with joy and with goodness of heart." And whoever carries hismelf haughtily and takes pride in himself and considers hismelf too dignified in such places is a sinner and a fool. Concerning this Solomon admonished and said: "Do not dignify yourself in front of a king." But whoever lowers himself and eases oneself in such places is the [real] great and dignified one who worships out of love. So did David, King of Israel, say: "...and I would be even less worthy than this and would be lowly in my own eyes." There is no greatness and honor but to rejoice before God, as it is stated: "And King David was spinning and crowing before God" etc. Finished are the laws of the Lulav, Praise to the Inspector of kidneys and heart
