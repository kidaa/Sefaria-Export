            "Another opinion regarding the verse (Ps. 50:23) “And there is a path, I will show him the salvation of God”- Rabbi Yanai said: the it is written the one who puts a path[with a sin and not a shin], meaning that two ways are similar [in bringing one to salvation] Rabbi Yannai was once walking along the road, and saw a man who was extremely well dressed. Rabbi Yannai said to him: Would you like to come over to my house? The man replied: Yes. Rabbi Yannai brought him into his home, and gave him food and drink. As they were eating and drinking together, he examined him in his knowledge of Bible, and found out that he had none; examined his knowledge of Mishnah, and realized that he had none; his knowledge of legends, and saw that he had none; his knowledge of Talmud and saw he had none. Rabbi Yannai then told him: Wash and recite grace. Said the guest: Let Yannai recite grace in his own home. Seeing that he could not even recite a blessing, Yannai told him: Can you at least repeat what I say? Said he: Yes. Said Rabbi Yannai: repeat the following: 'A dog has eaten Yannai's bread.' Offended, the man stood up, and grabbed Rabbi Yannai by the coat! He then said: My inheritance is with you, and you are withholding it from me! Said Rabbi Yannai with puzzlement: What legacy of yours is there with me? He replied: Once I passed by a school, and I heard the voices of the little children saying: 'Moses gave us the Torah, the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.' They did not say 'the inheritance of the congregation of Yannai,' but the 'congregation of Jacob.' Rabbi Yannai asked, “How then are you worthy to eat at my table?” The guest replied, “Never have I heard an evil word spoken against me and returned to argue with the person who spoke it. Never have I seen two people arguing without making peace between them.” Rabbi Yannai then said, “you have so much Derech Eretz and I called you a dog.” On him rabbi Yanai said the verse “And there is a path” – meaning not one, but two paths take you to salvation – since rabbi Ishmael son of rav Nachman said: Derech eretz precedes Torah by 26 generations, since it is written “and to guard the way to the Tree of Life” (Genesis 3). “Way” is the derech eretz, and only after that comes “Tree of Life” which is Torah. [Back to the verse in question, Ps 50:23] I will show him the salvation of God, said rabbi Abahu: this is one of the sources for the idea that God’s salvation is Israel’s salvation (Ps. 80:3) “and come and save us”",

            "Rabbi Pinchas, Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Yochanan [said] in the name of Rabbi Menachem from Gallia: In the time to come, all sacrifices will be annulled - but the sacrifice of thanksgiving will not be annulled.  All prayers will be annulled, but the prayer of gratitude will not be annulled.  This accords with what is written [Jeremiah 33:11]: \"The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say 'Give thanks to the LORD of hosts' etc.\" - this is the prayer of gratitude.  \"Those who bring [the sacrifice of] thanksgiving to the House of the LORD\": this is the sacrifice of thanksgiving.  Thus David said: \"I owe You vows and will offer you thanksgivings\" [Psalms 56:13] - not \"thanksgiving,\" but \"thanksgivings,\" [indicating both] the thanksgiving prayer and the prayer of gratitude.",

            "Said Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai: Peace is so great that all blessings are included in it (Ps. 29:11) “Hashem will give strength to His people, Hashem will bless His people with peace”. Hizkiah said two things. Hizkiah said: Peace is so great that all mitzvot are written [in the conditional form] (Exodus 23:4-5) “If you see” “If you encounter” (Deut. 22:6) “If you happen by” – if a mitzvah came to your hand, you are bound to do it. However, here (Ps. 34:15) “Seek peace and pursue it.” Seek – [this word applies] in your own place; pursue – [this word applies] in any other place. Hizkiah said gave another explanation: Peace is so great that about every travelling of the children of Israel it is written ‘and they travelled’ ‘and they encamped’ they travelled disputing [with each other] and encamped disputing. But when they arrived at Mount Sinai they did one single encampment, as it is written ‘and Israel encamped [verb in singular] there’ – it is not written ‘they encamped there’, rather, it is written ‘he encamped there.’ At the moment the Holy One of Blessing said ‘this is the moment I will give Torah to the children of Israel’"

            "\"And it was on the 8th day\" [Leviticus 9:1] - Rav Ahava bar Kahane opened with: [Proverbs 9:1-4] \"Wisdom has built her house, [she has hewn out her seven pillars]\" \"She has prepared her food, [she has mixed her wine, she has even set her table]\" \"She has sent forth her maidens, [she calls out from the heights]\" \"Whoever is simple [will turn here, whoever is lacking understanding]...\" Rabbi Yirmiya bar Ilai interpreted these [difficult] verses with the creation of the world. \"Wisdom has built her house...\" - That is the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is written, [Proverbs 3:19] \"God has founded the earth with wisdom.\" \"She has hewn out her seven pillar\" - That is the seven days of creation, as it says, [Exodus 20:11] \"For six days...\" [Genesis 2:3] \"And God blessed the seventh day.\" \"She has prepared her food\", [that refers to] [Genesis 1:24] \"And God said, Let the earth bring forth...\" \"She has mixed her wine\", [that refers to] [Genesis 1:9] \"And God said, Let the waters be gathered...\" \"She has even set her table\" - [that refers to] [Genesis 1:11] \"And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself...\" \"She has sent forth her maidens\" - that is Adam and Eve. \"She calls out from the heights\" - [this refers to] that God moved them, and he called them divine, and that's what is written [Genesis 3:5] \"and you will be like gods\". After all of this praise, \"whoever is simple will turn here\", they will leave aside the intent of God, and follow after the intent of the serpent, and therefore are \"lacking understanding\".

            "\"A woman when she gives seed (conceives)\" [Leviticus 12:2]: That's what is written, \"You have created me behind and before.\" [Psalms 139:5] Said Rabbi Yochanan: If man merits, he inherits two worlds, this one and the coming one, that's what is written: \"You have created me behind and before (front).\" And if not, he comes to give reckoning, as it says, \"And You laid your hand (kapcha) on me.\" [ibid], as it is written, [Job 13:21] \"Withdraw your hand (kapcha) far from me.\" Said Rav Shmuel bar Nachman: When the Holy One, blessed be He, created the first man, he created him as an androgynous being. Reish Lakish: When it was created, dual faces [together] were created, and it was cut, and two were made. [One] back was male, [one] back was female. They challenged him: [Genesis 2:21] \"And He took one of his ribs (tzela)\"!? He said to them, it is of his sides, as it is written, \"and to the side (tzela) of the Tabernacle\" [Exodus 26:20]. Said Rabbi Berachiya and Rabbi Chelbo and Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman: When God created the first man, from one end of the world to the other end, He created him to fill the entire world. How do we know from east to west? As it says, \"You created me back to east (kedem).\" How do we know from north to south? As it says, [Deuteronomy 4:32] \"From the ends of the heavens to the ends of the heavens.\" How do we know that it was the expanse of the world? As it says, \"And You laid your hand on me.\" Said Rabbi Elazar: \"Behind\" - that's the first day [of creation]. \"Before\" - that's the last day. For the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, there is the verse, [Genesis 1:24]: \"Let the earth bring forth the living soul (nefesh chaya) to its kind.\" \"Living soul\" - that's the spirit of the first man. Said Reish Lakish: \"Behind\" - that's the last day. \"Before\" - that's the first day. For the opinion of Reish Lakish, there is the verse: [Genesis 1:2] \"And the spirit of God wavered upon the water\" - that is the spirit of the king messiah. If man merits, we say to him: \"You were created before all of creation.\" If not, we say to him, \"The mosquito preceded you.\" Said Rabbi Yishmale b'Rabbi Tanchum: \"Behind\" on all creation, \"before\" (first) in all punishments. Said Rabbi Yochanan: Even man's praise only comes last, as it says [Psalms 148:110]: \"Beasts and all cattle creeping things and flying fowl\". And afterwards, [Psalms 148:11]: \"Kings of the earth and all peoples.\" Said Rabbi Simlai: \"Just like man's formation was after beast, cattle, and bird, so too his laws are after beast, cattle, and bird, and that's what is written, \"This is the law of cattle\" [Leviticus 11:46], and afterwards, \"A woman when she gives seed...\"",

            "... Another possibility:  \"When a woman conceives and gives birth to a male\" [Leviticus 12:2]   Thus when it is written \"Life and lovingkindness you have given me, Your care has guarded my spirit\" [Job 10:12]  Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said three [things]:  In the way of the world if a person takes a purse of money and places the opening downward, does not the money scatter?!  A fetus that rests in the womb of his mother, The Holy Blessed One guards him so he does not fall and die, is this not praiseworthy?!  Thus - \"Life and lovingkindness you have given me.\"  Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said also: It is the way of the world that an animals breasts are in the place of the womb and the newborn nurses in a shameful place.  But a woman, her breasts are in a beautiful place, and the newborn nurses in a place of honor.  Is this not \"life and lovingkindness?\"  Thus - \"Life and lovingkindness you have given me.\"  Rabbi Elazar said, if a person tarries in a hot place for one hour, does he not die?   Yet the womb of the woman boils, and the fetus which is placed inside the womb, The Holy Blessed One protects it, it is not aborted in the shape of a bag, it is not aborted as the placenta, nor aborted in the shape of a sandal - is this not \"life and lovingkindess?\"  Thus - \"Life and lovingkindness you have given me.\"  Rabbi Tachalifa of Cesaerea If a person eats one portion of food after another portion of food, does not the second portion expel the first?  But no matter how much food a woman eats or how much liquid she drinks, the fetus is not expelled - is this not \"life and lovingkindness?\"   Rabbi Simon said, the womb of a woman is made with many cavities, many coils, and many bands.  At the moment that a woman sits on the birth chair, (the baby) does not get cast out all at once. There is a saying, \"If one band is loosened, two bands are loosened\".  Rabbi Meir said: All nine months that a woman does not see blood, she really should have seen it.  What did The Holy Blessed One do?  He removed (the blood) upward to her breasts and made it milk, so that when the baby was born there would be food for him to eat.  Even more if it was a male child, as it says: \"When a woman conceives and gives birth to a male.\"  "

He [Titus] began to revile and blaspheme saying, “He who wages battle with a king in the desert and triumphs is different from him who wages battle in the king's own palace and vanquishes him.” What did he [Titus] do? He gathered all of the Temple vessels and put them in a sack and descended to a ship.  At sea, a wave rose up to drown him.  He said, “It would appear that this nation's god has power only on water.  He [God] only punished the generation of Enosh with water, likewise He could only punish the generation of the flood with water, the generation of the Dispersal and Pharaoh and his army were only punished with water.  So I, when I was in His house and domain He had no power to stand against me, and now he opposes me here!”  The Holy One said, “By your life, I will punish you with the most insignificant of my creatures.”  Immediately God hinted to the sea and it stayed its anger. When he arrived in Rome, all of the citizens came out and acclaimed him: “Conqueror of the Barbarians.”  Immediately they heated the bath-house and he entered and washed himself.  When he came out they poured for him the double glass for after the bath, and God appointed a mosquito for him and it entered his nose and gnawed its way up until it reached his brain.  He said, “Call for the doctors to split open the head of that man [Titus] so I can know with what the God of that nation has punished him.”  Forthwith they summoned the doctors, and they split open his brain and found in it the likeness of a young dove and its weight was two litras.  R. Elazar son of R. Yosi said: I was there, and they put the young bird on one side [of the scales], and two litras on the other, and they balances one another.  They took it and put it in a bowl, and as the mosquito withered so Titus deteriorated.  The mosquito flew away, and away flew the soul of the wicked Titus....",

            "Rabbi Pinhas in the name of Rabbi Levi stated: This is comparable to a king’s son who strayed and was accustomed to eat non-kosher meat. The king declared, “let him always eat at my table and on his own he will eventually become disciplined.” Similarly, because Israel was attached to idolatry in Egypt and would bring their sacrifices to the goat-demons, as it is written (Leviticus 17:7) \"No longer shall you sacrifice to goat-demons, which refer to the shedim they sacrificed to (Deuternomy 32:17) \"and they sacrificed to shedim\", and those shedim refer to the goat-demons, as it says, (Isaiah 13:21) \"and the goat [demons] shall prance there.\" And they would offer sacrifices on high places and retribution would befall them, the Holy One blessed be He said “let them offer sacrifices before Me at all times in the Tent of Meeting and they will be separated from idolatry and be saved.” This is the meaning of what is written (Leviticus 17:3-7): “Any man of the House of Israel who slaughters an ox or sheep or goat... and does not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting as a sacrifice to God.... that man will be cut off from among his people… so that they no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat-demons that they are wont to stray after.\""

David said, 'In all of the limbs, there are no greater ones than these, as they are compared to the entire body.' This is [what is meant] by 'All of my bones shall say.'\"",

And Shlomo was wiser than all men,\" these four species were perplexing to him, as it is stated (Proverbs 30:18), \"Three are there that are wondrous beyond me\" - these three are the Pesach sacrifice, matsa and marror (bitter herbs) - \"and four which I did not know\" - these four are the four species of the lulav, that he sought to understand: \"The fruit of a beautiful tree\" - who will tell me that it is a citron (etrog)? All of the trees make beautiful fruit (and are hence called beautiful trees).  \"The branches of a date palm\" - the Torah said, \"take two palm branches (as 'branches' is in the plural) to praise with\" and he only takes a [singular] lulav, which is the heart of the date palm. \"And a branch of a braided tree (a myrtle)\" - who will tell me that it is a myrtle? Behold, in another place it says (Nechemiah 8:15), \"Go out to the mountain and bring olive branches, etc\" (the verse continues to list several species and mentions myrtles alongside branches of a braided tree, seemingly indicating that they are two different species). \"And brook willows\" - all trees grow in the water! [Hence,] \"and four which I did not know.\" He came back and mentioned them a different time, as it is stated (Proverbs 30:29), \"There are three that are good, etc.\" - these are the four species, that each and every one in Israel goes and runs and takes from them for himself, to praise the Holy One, blessed be He. And [the four species] appear small in the eyes of man but they are great in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And who explained to Israel that they were these four species, which are the citron, the palm branch, the myrtle, the willow?

            "﻿7. R. Ze'ira said: Even the ordinary conversation of the people of the Land of Israel is Torah. How is this? A man would say to his neighbour: \"Give me charity\"  [z'kaai bi or izdakai bi {the Hebrew רכי is a corruption}, as if to say]: benefit yourself through me. R. Haggai says: [A man would say] \"Look [sakai] at me; look [istakai] at me\" [intimating] look at me - what I was, and look at me - what I am [now]. For R. Haggai said in the name of R. Yohanan: It is written, \"And those riches perish by evil ways [inyan]\" (Ecclesiastes 5:13) - that he [the one being asked] answered the poor man in an evil way [inyan], saying to him: \"You do not go to work and [therefore have no food to] eat? See what forelegs! See what legs! See that stomach! See that flesh!\" The Holy One, blessed be He [then] says to him: \"Not only have you not given him anything that belongs to you, but what you did give him you gave with an evil eye. Consequently, \"If he gives birth to a son, there is nothing in his hand\" (ibid.) of everything he [once] possessed [to bequeath]."

            "\"If you walk in My statutes...\" This is what is written - \"I considered my ways and I turned my feet to your testimonies...(Theism 119:59).\" Dovid Hamelech said, \"Master of the Universe! Everyday I would plan and say that I have to go to a certain particular place today, or to a particular dwelling. And my feet would bring me to a house of prayer or a house of learning. \" This is what is meant by \"And I turned my feet to Your testimony....\"",

            "Rabbi Elazar said: In the way the world functions, a king of flesh and blood decrees a decree; if he wants to fulfill it, then he fulfills it, if he doesn’t [want to], ultimately it will be fulfilled by others. But the Blessed One is not like this, rather, if God decrees a decree, God will fulfill it first, as it says in the verse: (Leviticus 19:32) “You shall rise up before the hoary (greyish white) head, and honor the face of the old, and you shall fear your God: I am the LORD.” I fulfilled the commandment of standing up for the old first, “If you will walk in My statutes.” "
