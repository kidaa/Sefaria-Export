                "\"And passes over transgression\" (Micah 7:18) This is a great a great quality, for behold, forgiveness is not through an emissary but rather through the hand of the Holy Blessed One, as it is written, \"For with you is forgiveness,\" (Psalm 130:4), forgiveness being that God washes away transgression, as it is written, \"When my lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Judah\" (Ezekiel 36:25), and so it us written, \"I will sprinkle upon you ritually pure waters.\" This is the meaning of \"And passes over transgression,\" sending forth from the waters of washing, and works, and washes away the sin. ", 
                "And behold, just like this, a human being needs to be, for they shall not say, \"And shall I fix what Joe Shmoe sinned or corrupted?\" They shall not say thus, for when someone sins, it is the Holy Blessed One,Godself--and not through an emissary--that God fixes the transgression and washes away the filth of their transgression. ", 
                "And from here, the person will be too ashamed to sin again, for behold, the Ruler, Godself washes their filthy clothes. "
