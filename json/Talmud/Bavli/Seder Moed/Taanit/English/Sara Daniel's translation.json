            "R. Shmuel b. Nahmani said in the name of R. Yohanan: Why was Josiah punished? Because he should have consulted with Jeremiah but he did not. What was Josiah's proof text? \"And no sword shall pass through your land\" [Lev. 26:6]. What does the word \"sword\" mean? If you interpret it as a non-peaceful sword, Scripture has already stated, \"I shall restore peace upon the land.\" Rather, it means even a peaceful sword. But he did not know that his generation had found little favor in God's eyes. As Josiah was dying, Jeremiah noticed that his lips were moving. Jeremiah said: Perhaps, God forbid, he is saying something unworthy out of pain. He crouched down and heard him justifying the judgement that had been passed on him. Josiah was saying: \"The Lord is righteous, for I rebelled against His word [Lamentations 1:18]. At that moment, Jeremiah lamented him saying: \"The air we breathe, the anointed one of God, was trapped in their pits\" [Lam. 4:20]."
