Chapter 32

Give ear, O heavens, let me speak; Let the earth hear the words I utter!
...May my discourse come down as the rain, My speech distill as the dew, Like showers on young growth, Like droplets on the grass.
...For the name of the Eternal I proclaim; Give glory to our God!
...The Rock! - whoes deeds are perfect, Yea, all God's way are just;
...Unworthy children -that crooked, perverse generation - Their baseness has played God false.
...Do you thus requite Eternal, O dull and witless people? Is not this the Father who created you  -Fashioned you and made you endure!
...Remember the days of old, consider the years of ages passed; Ask your parent, who will inform you, Your elders, who will tell you:
...When the Most High gave nations their homes and set the divisions of humanity, [God] fixed the boundaries of peoples In relation to Israel's numbers.
...For the Eternal's portion is this people; Jacob, God's own allotment.
...[God] found them in a desert region, in an empty housing waste. [God] engirded them, watched over them, Guarded them as the pupil of God's eye
...Like an eagle who rouses it's nestlings, Gliding down to is young, So did [God] spread wings and take them, Bear along on pinions;
The Eternal alone did guide them, No alien god alongside.
