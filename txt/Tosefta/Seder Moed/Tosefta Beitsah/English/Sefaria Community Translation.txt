Tosefta Beitsah

Chapter 1


One who slaughters a chicken and finds inside in complete eggs  (These are permitted to [eat on Yom Tov]). An egg where most of it has come out on the eve of Yom Tov (even though it was fully out on Yom Tov, it is permitted [to eat on Yom Tov]). [If] it was laid on Shabbat- it may be eaten on Yom Tov. [If] it was laid on Yom Tov- it may be eaten on Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer- Still there are  arguments in that regard; Just as it is prohibited to eat [the egg], so too it is prohibited to handle it. Just as [where there is] a doubt [weather or not] it is prohibited, so too [something] that has a doubt [of weather or not] it is prepared is prohibited [on Yom Tov]. [If this egg] were to be mixed with even one hundred- all [the eggs] would be prohibited.
