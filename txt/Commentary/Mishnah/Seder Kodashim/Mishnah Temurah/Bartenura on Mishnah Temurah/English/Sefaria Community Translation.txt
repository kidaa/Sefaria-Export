Mishna 5

How may one act cleverly [to circumvent the law] regarding a firstborn [animal]? [One owns] a pregnant animal  about to give birth for the first time, and says, "Whatever is inside of this [animal], if it is a male, [it is dedicated] as an <i>Olah</i> [offering that is entirely burnt]" - if it gives birth to a male, it [the newborn animal] is offered as an <i>Olah</i>. [If he says,] "[If] it is a female, [it is dedicated] as a <i>Shelamim</i> [an offering whose various parts are consumed by its owners, the Kohanim and the fire on the altar]" - if it gives birth to a female, it is offered as a <i>Shelamim</i>. [If he says,] "[If] it is a male, [it is dedicated] as an <i>Olah</i>; if it is a female, [it is dedicated] as a <i>Shelamim</i>" - if it gives birth to a male and a female, the male is an <i>Olah</i> and the female a <i>Shelamim</i>.
If an animal gives birth to two males, one is offered as an <i>Olah</i> and the second is sold to one who needs to offer an <i>Olah</i>, and its payment is not holy. If it gave birth to two females, one is offered as a <i>Shelamim</i> and the second is sold to one who needs to offer a <i>Shelamim</i>, and the money is not holy. If it gave birth to an animal of indeterminate sex or a hermaphrodite, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: holiness does not take effect regarding them.
If one says, "This animal's fetus is an <i>Olah</i>, and [the animal] is a <i>Shelamim</i>," - his words stand; "[This animal] is a <i>Shelamim</i>, and its fetus is an <i>Olah</i>," the fetus is a <i>Shelamim</i> - [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir; Rabbi Yosi says: If this is what he originally intended [that the fetus would be an <i>Olah</i>], then, since it is [physically] impossible to pronounce two names at one time, his words stand; if, when he said "this is a <i>Shelamim</i>," he then changed his mind and said [i.e., added], "the fetus is an <i>Olah</i>," then the fetus is a <i>Shelamim</i>.
[If one said], "This [animal] is [both] a substitute for an <i>Olah</i> and a substitute for a <i>Shelamim</i>," then it is a substitute for the <i>Olah</i> - [these are] the words of Rabbi Meir; Rabbi Yosi says: If this is what he intended originally, then since it is [physically] impossible to pronounce two names at one time, his words stand; if, when he said "[This animal is] a substitute for an <i>Olah</i>," he then changed his mind and said [i.e., added], "[This animal is] a substitute for a Shelamim," then it is a substitute for an <i>Olah</i>.
[If one said], "This [animal] instead of that," "as a substitute for that," "as an exchange for that," then [this animal] is a substitute [for that animal]; [if he said], "[This animal] has its sanctity transferred onto that one," then [this animal] is not a substitute; if [, however, this animal] was a [sanctified] animal with a blemish, then it [does] lose its sanctity [upon that substituted animal], and [the owner] needs to make [restitution for any difference in] price.
[If one said], "This [animal] is instead of a <i>Chattat</i> [offering brought to expiate sin]," or "instead of an <i>Olah</i>," he has not said anything. "[This animal] is instead of this <i>Chattat</i> ," or "instead of this <i>Olah</i>," "instead of the <i>Chattat</i> or the <i>Olah</i>, which I have inside the house." - if he had [the animal], his words stand. If he said regarding an impure animal or a blemished animal, "This is an <i>Olah</i>," he has not said anything; [if he says], "This is for an <i>Olah</i>," he sells it and uses the money for an <i>Olah</i>.
