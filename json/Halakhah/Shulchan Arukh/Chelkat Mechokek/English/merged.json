            "It is prohibited to spill seed needlessly. See Sefer Hasidim no. 176 who writes that if someone is worried about transgressing with a married woman or when his wife is a niddah it is better to spill seed in vain rather than transgressing the prohibition of [forbidden relations with a] married woman or a menstruating woman. However he should fast forty days in the summer or sit in ice in the winter."
