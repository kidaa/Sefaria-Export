Sefer Tomer Devorah

Perek 1



Seif 1

It is proper for man to emulate his Creator, for then he will attain the secret of the Divine Form in both image and likeness. For if a person's physical form reflect the Divine Form, yet his actions do not, he falsifies his stature. People will say "A handsome form whose deeds are ugly."  For the essential aspect of the Divine 'Form' and 'Likeness' is that they are the deeds of the Holy One, Blessed Be He. Therefore, what good is it for a person to reflect the Divine Form in a physical form only if his deeds do not imitate those of his creator? Thus, it is proper that man's action imitate the Thirteen Divine Attributes of Mercy- the function of the Sefirah of Keter- hinted at in these verses: " Who is G-d like You, who forgives wickedness and forgives the transgression of the remaining of His heritage? He does not maintain His anger forever, for he delights in kindness. he will again show us compassion, He will destroy our wickedness, and You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. Show faithfulness to Ya'akov, kindness to Avraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from days of old" (Michah 7:18-20) As a result, it is proper that these Thirteen Attributes, which we will now explain, should also be found in man.
