And it was customary in a number of Jewish communities, that the Shamash (attendant of the community or synagogue) would go [around the neighborhood] each morning and knock on door[s] or window[s] to awaken all those sleeping for prayers and to serve Hashem (God).

                "It is worthy and good for every G-d fearer to be troubled and worried by the destruction of the Bet Hamikdash and the exile of the Shekhinah, as it says, \"Get up and sing in the night, at the beginning of the watches.\" And just like the Holy One, Blessed be He laments at that time, and says, \"Woe to me that I destroyed my house...\" like this for everyone who G-d touched his heart to lament in the middle of the night about the destruction, and on the spreading of Israel through the nations, and the exile of the Torah, and the killing of the righteous. And everybody who is able to wake up in the middle of the night, he should do it and say \"Tikkun Hasot\". And also, if you remain awake until the middle of the night, try not to sleep until you say Tikkun Hasot, to join with the pain of the Shekhinah in exile. However, when you pray and learn Torah you should be happy. And in any case, if you cry during the prayer, you prayer is accepted more."

                "Any person who has a conflict with his fellow, should not permit himself to confidently maintain the justness of his position, because \"one does not see his own wrong\" (Shabbat 119a). Rather, he should put forth his claims with truth and simplicity before an established Rabbi, asking him to rule whether or not he is obligated to return money to his fellow. And even if his fellow is not bringing him to court, he is still obligated to fulfill his obligation towards heaven by asking a Torah scholar who is an expert decision-maker, as it is written (Mishna Avot Ch.1) \"Make for yourself a Rabbi and avoid doubt\". And even if his fellow does not know of the theft that was taken from him, one still has to return what was stolen and appease him. [Yalkut Yosef Moadim pg. 78. Chazon Ovadia on High Holidays pg.240]"
