            "There were three features possessed by the prophecy of Balaam that were absent from that of Moses: 1) Moses did not know who was speaking with him, whereas Balaam knew who was speaking with him; 2) Moses did not know when the Holy One Blessed Be He would speak with him, whereas Balaam knew...3) Balaam spoke with Him whenever he pleased...Moses, however, did not speak with Him whenever he wished."
