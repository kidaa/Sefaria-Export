Rut Rabba

Chapter 1



Chapter 2

Rabbi Simon, in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and Rabbi Chama the father of Rabbi Hoshea in the name of Rabbi [Yehudah]: Chronicles was only given for exegetical purposes.












"God will deal kindly with you(Ruth 1:8)" . Rabbi Chanina bar Ada says, "Will show (ya'aseh)" is what is written (k'tiv),  "as you showed with the dead (ibid)" when you were occupied with their shrouds, "and with me (ibid)" when they renounced their ketubot.  Rabbi Zeira says, "This scroll does not have anything in it concerned with impurity or purity nor what is forbidden and what is permitted.  So why is it written?  To teach us the greatness of the reward for acts of lovingkindness."





"And Ruth said: entreat me not to leave you and to return from following you"-- what does "entreat" [lit. "hurt"] mean?  Ruth said to Naomi, "Do not sin against me by telling me to leave and return from following you. I intend to convert anyway, and it is better that I do it with you than with someone else." When Naomi heard this, she immediately began to lay out before her the laws of conversion. Naomi said, "My daughter, Jewish women do not go to the non-Jews' theaters and circuses." Ruth said, "Where you go, I will go." Naomi said, "My daughter, Jewish women do not live in a house where there is no mezuzah." Ruth said, "Where you lodge, I will lodge." "Your people shall be my people," refers to warning and punishment, and "Your God shall be my God" refers to the rest of the mitzvot.  

"And Ruth said, 'Do not urge me to leave you, to turn and not follow after you'(Ruth 1:16)."  What does it mean, 'do not urge me'?  She said to her, "Do not sin against me, do not turn your misfortunes from me."  "To turn and follow after you(ibid)."  It has been my intention in every instance to convert, but it is better at your hands than at the hands of another.  When Naomi heard this she began to expound to her the laws of converts.  She said to her, "My daughter, it is not the custom of daughters of Israel to go to their theaters and their circuses.  She replied to her, "Where you go, I will go (ibid."  She said to her, "My daughter, it is not the custom of Israel to dwell in a house that does not have a mezuzah."  She replied to her, "Where you lodge I will lodge.(ibid)."  "Your people will be my people (ibid)," these are the punishments and the warnings. "And Your God will be my God (ibid)," the other commandments.
