AND JOSEPH SAW HIS BRETHREN, AND HE KNEW THEM, BUT MADE HIMSELF STRANGE UNTO THEM: R. Joshua b. R. Nehemiah said: He made himself a stranger to them. AND JOSEPH KNEW HIS BRETHREN: when they fell into his hand. BUT THEY KNEW NOT HIM: when he fell into their hands. The Rabbis said: He had left them bearded, therefore, AND JOSEPH KNEW HIS BRETHREN; but they had left him beardless, consequently, BUT THEY KNEW NOT HIM. WE ARE ALL ONE MAN'S SONS: The holy spirit was enkindled in them and they said to him [unwittingly]: You and we are the sons of the same man.
