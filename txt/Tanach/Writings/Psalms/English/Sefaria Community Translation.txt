1. For the conductor, a song of David.
2. The Lord will answer you on a day of distress; the name of the God of Jacob will fortify you.
3. He will send your aid from His sanctuary, and support you from Zion.
4. He will remember all your meal offerings and He will accept your fat burnt offerings forever.
5. He will give you as your heart [desires], and all your plans He will fulfill.
6. We will rejoice in your salvation, and assemble in the name of our God; the Lord will fulfill all your requests.
7. Now I know that the Lord saved His anointed; He answered him from His holy heavens; with the mighty acts of salvation from His right hand.
8. These trust in chariots and these in horses, but we with the mentioning of the name of the Lord our God.
9. They kneel and fall, but we rise and gain strength.
10. O Lord, save [us]; the King will answer us on the day we call.

For the Leader. [A Psalm] of David; to make memorial. O God, to deliver me, O LORD, to help me, make haste.
Let them be ashamed and abashed That seek after my soul; Let them be turned backward and brought to confusion That delight in my hurt.
Let them be turned back by reason of their shame That say: 'Aha, aha.'
Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; And let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'Let God be magnified.'
But I am poor and needy; O God, make haste unto me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, tarry not.

Chapter 145

[A Psalm of] praise; of David.  I will extol Thee, my God, O King; And I will bless Thy name for ever and ever.
Every day will I bless Thee; And I will praise Thy name for ever and ever.
Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; And His greatness is unsearchable.
One generation shall laud Thy works to another, And shall declare Thy mighty acts.
The glorious splendour of Thy majesty, And Thy wondrous works, will I rehearse.
And men shall speak of the might of Thy tremendous acts; And I will tell of Thy greatness.
They shall utter the fame of Thy great goodness, And shall sing of Thy righteousness.
The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; Slow to anger, and of great mercy.
The LORD is good to all;  And His tender mercies are over all His works.
All Thy works shall praise Thee, O LORD; And Thy saints shall bless Thee.
They shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom, And talk of Thy might;
To make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, And the glory of the majesty of His kingdom.
Thy kingdom is a kingdom for all ages, And Thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
The LORD upholdeth all that fall, And raiseth up all those that are bowed down.
The eyes of all wait for Thee, And Thou givest them their food in due season.
Thou openest Thy hand, And satisfiest every living thing with favour.
The LORD is righteous in all His ways, And gracious in all His works.
The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon Him, To all that call upon Him in truth.
He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him; He also will hear their cry, and will save them.
The LORD preserveth all them that love Him; But all the wicked will He destroy.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD; And let all flesh bless His holy name for ever and ever.
