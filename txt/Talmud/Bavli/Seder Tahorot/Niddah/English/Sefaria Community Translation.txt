Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

Mishnah:
Shammai says,
All women, their hour (i.e. the time at which they see menstrual blood) is [a] sufficient (starting point for determining whether the terumot and taharot they handled are ritually impure).
Hillel says,
From [a more recent] check (where she is found to be ritually impure) to [an earlier] check (where she is found to be ritually pure, all terumot and taharot handled will be retroactively declared impure), and even where there are many days [in between checks].
And the sages say,
The law is neither like this (Shammai, who is lenient) nor like this (Hillel, who is stringent). Rather a twenty four hour period can reduce (a longer than twenty four hour period) between two checks, and a period between two checks (that is less than twenty four hours) can reduce a twenty four hour period.
Any woman who has a regular time (i.e. menstrual cycle), her hour (i.e. the time at which she sees menstrual blood) is [a] sufficient (starting point for determining whether the terumot and taharot she handled are ritually impure).
And a woman who uses cloths [to perform a check (i.e. bedikah) at the time of intercourse], this counts as a [valid] check (i.e. bedikah) [for the purposes of determining which terumot and taharot are retroactively ritually impure], and [such a check] can reduce a twenty four hour period as well as period of time in between two checks (i.e. bedikot) [that is less than twenty four hours].
What is an example of, "her hour (i.e. the time at which they see menstrual blood) is [a] sufficient (starting point for determining whether the terumot and taharot they handled are ritually impure)"?
She was sitting on a bed, dealing with taharot (i.e. ritually pure items), and she separates [from the bed and the taharot] and [afterwards] sees [blood], she is ritually impure, and they (the bed and the taharot) are ritually pure.
Even though [the sages] said,
that she causes [terumah and taharot] to retroactively become ritually impure for [a maximum of] twenty four hours, she only [begins to] count [days of Niddah impurity] from the time she sees [blood].
Gemarah:
What is the reasoning of Shammai?
[Shammai] reasons,
"Maintain the woman on her status, and the woman [in our Mishnah] has a status of ritual purity."
And Hillel [reasons], "When [we] say 'maintain something on its status', [that] is where it does not have an inherent disqualification. However, a woman

Daf 2b

since she sees [the blood] from her body, we do not say "uphold her (status of ritual purity) [based] on her establishment (of being ritually pure to begin with)."
And how is [the case of our Mishnah] different [from the case] of Mikvah?
As we learn in a Mishnah

Rav Yosef said:
It such a thing one happened in Pumbedita and she was healed.
Rav Yosef said in the name of Rav Yehuda who said in the Name of Rav: Rebbi enacted this in in the fields:
If she saw one day, she waits six. Two, she waits six. Three, she waits seven clean days.
Rav Zeira said:
The daughters of Israel took it upon themselves that if they see even a drop of blood the size of a mustard seed, they wait seven clean days.
