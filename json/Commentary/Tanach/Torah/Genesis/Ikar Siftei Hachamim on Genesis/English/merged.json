                "That since the Torah was only given to Israel in order that they observe the commandments written in them (and that is why it is called Torah [Hebrew for instruction]); if so, all of these stories should not have been written in the Torah, but rather should have comprised a different book, like the Book of Joshua or the Book of Judges.", 
                "Which is not the case with circumcision and the sciatic nerve, since only individuals were commanded (for themselves and for all of Israel), and so long as all of Israel was not commanded to [do] them, they are not considered to be from [the Torah's] commandments, since it is written \"Moshe commanded us the Torah\" (Deuteronomy 33:4) [hence anything not commanded to the people through Moshe, is not considered Torah].", 
                "It is a statement and an answer, which means to say that the verse in Psalms explains the reason why it starts with \"In the beginning.\" And this is what is understood from the verse, \"the power of His actions,\" the explanation of ['His actions' being] the creation story, and that is why He \"told His people;\" because He wanted \"to give them the inheritance of the nations;\" because of Avraham, who God promised that He would give the Land of Canaan to his descendants (and this inheritance is from the rewards of the commandments and is [so] considered like a commandment; and if so, it needs to inform that the creation is 'the power of His deeds'). There is also [another explanation]; it was difficult for Rashi: it should have written the Book of Genesis after Ha'azinu [towards the end of the Torah] and not to begin with it here, and he answers; \"because of the 'Power of His actions, etc.,'\" meaning to say, if it had written the Book of Genesis at the end of [the Torah], it would not have been a proof that [these] writings are coming to testify that the Children of Israel are not like thieves; but rather, we would have said that the reason the Book of Genesis [is written] is to tell [us] that the world is not pre-existing, which is a fundamental principle of faith, and as is written by Ramban. But now that it began with Genesis, per force, we must say that it is to explain, \"Because of 'the power of His actions, etc.,'\" meaning that the verse itself is testifying to this. And be exact and find the truth [to this].", 
                "It is implied that at first, the land belonged to the seven nations (and they were of the children of Cham). And if you will ask; and behold in Parshat Lech Lecha (below, Genesis 12:6), it is written, \"and the Canaanites were then in the land,\" and Rashi there explains that they were in the process of conquering the land of Israel from the descendants of Shem - since it fell in the portion of Shem, when Noach divided the world to his sons; and if so, in what way is it relevant [to speak] about theft here (when they are securing their own property); and it appears to me [that the answer is] that even though land may not be stolen (Sukkah 30b) and it stands in the domain of the original owner (meaning, that one who sits on it has no legal claim to it), nonetheless, it is like [the case] of a thief - like one who goes into the property of his friend without permission to improve the land (Ketuvot 80a) - [in which case, the owner] must give him [his] expenses, if the improvement is greater than the expenses; and Israel took [back] the land of Israel and did not even give the expenses. And for this reason, it opens with \"In the beginning, etc.,\" to say that the earth and all that is in it belongs to the Holy One, blessed be He, to do according to His will with it - \"'He saw and shook out (<i>yater</i>) the nations' (Habakuk 3:6); He permitted (<i>hitir</i>) the money (property) of the nations\" (Baba Kama 38a).  And one can also answer, that [it makes sense to say \"you are thieves,\" since Shem also had other children, and they also had a share in the land. Still, it is difficult even if you say that Rabbi Yitschak held that it was all [actually the property] of Cham and he gave it to his son, Canaan. Nonetheless, behold, it is written (below, Genesis 9:25), \"cursed is Canaan, a slave of slaves, etc.;\" if so, Cham was a slave to Shem and what is acquired by a slave is [legally] acquired by his master (Pesachim 88b). And one can answer that it is written (in the verse just cited], \"to his brothers,\" that he should also be a slave to Yefet; if so, Yefet also has a portion in [the land]. (And one can also answer that it is specifically concerning acquisition or laying a claim from that of others or that which is ownerless that we say that the 'hand' of the slave is like the 'hand' of his master, but not concerning inheritance - since we establish [the law to be] (Kiddushin 17b), \"from the word of the Torah, a heathen inherits [the property] of his father\" - and Canaan inherited the land from his father, Cham [Nachalat Yakov, see over there].) ", 
                "Since according to its simple meaning, it implies that it is coming to teach the order of creation; and this cannot be as Rashi explains nearby, \"as there is no [usage of the word,] <i>reishit</i> (beginning of), etc.\" ", 
                "And it would not be a term [indicating] a 'beginning,' which [would then] need to be be relational [to the next word]. And this would be the explanation of \"<i>bereishit</i>:\" for the sake of the Torah and of Israel (and the function of the [letter,] bet [at the beginning of the word] is [to indicate] 'for the sake of'). ", 
                "He means to say that \"<i>bereishit</i>\" would be relational. And then from the [next] word, \"created\" - which is a past tense verb - you must make a noun, as if it was written, \"the creating of (<i>briat</i>)\" in the place of \"created (<i>bara</i>).\" As there is preeminence to the written tradition (Makkot 7b) - and since it was handed down without vocalization, one can read  \"<i>baro</i> (His creating)\" [with the letters of]  \"<i>bara</i>.\"  ", 
                "As \"<i>Bereshit bara</i>\" is like \"In the beginning of its creation (<i>Betechillat briatah</i>) - and in that beginning of creation, the earth was chaos and void and darkness, and since it was dark, for that reason, God said, 'let there be light.'\" And the entire matter is connected with, \"And God said.\"", 
                "So that you should not say, how can he explain \"<i>bereishit</i>,\" as \"the beginning of the heavens, etc.,\" and that everything [leads to] \"And God said;\" and so [too, how can], \"And God said\" be connected to what is before. And behold, \"And God said, 'let there be light,'\" implies that it is an independent statement, like \"And God said, 'let there be a firmament,' etc.\" And that is why he brings a proof from Hosea. He means to say that over there also, it is not plausible to say that the beginning of the word of the Holy One, blessed be He - in that he spoke with someone - was with Hoshea; since behold, before Hoshea, he spoke with several [other] prophets. But [in fact] this is its explanation: \"The beginning of the Holy One's, blessed be He, speech to Hoshea,\" what was it? \"And God said to Hoshea, etc.\" And it is connected with \"and God said.\" So too is it here.", 
                "And as it is difficult for you; since there is no [usage of the word,] <i>reishit</i> (beginning of), except when it is connected [to another word that is after it]; one can answer that its explanation is \"the beginning of everything.\" And if so, it works well, as it is connected to the word, 'everything.' ", 
                "Since it makes sense if you say that it is not coming to teach the order of what came earlier and what came later; it fits well that it does not explain when was the creation of the waters - since it only wants to explain things that were created after the creation of the heavens and the earth. But if it is coming to teach the order of the creation, it is difficult - why would it not also explain the creation of the waters?", 
                "And that which he answers here and does not bring this answer above, concerning [what he writes], \"And [the verse] is not coming, etc.,\" and he should have said there, \"if so, you should wonder about [what] you [are saying], etc.;\" one can answer that above, one could push it off [by saying], that [these verses are] only recounting the earlier creations from the creation of the heavens and the earth and onwards, and it did not recount what was before this. But here, since he explained [it] as \"the beginning of everything\" - which implies that He did not create anything before the heavens and the earth - if so, it is difficult; \"you should wonder, etc.;\"", 
                "If his opinion is that it should say, 'the Lord' and not say, 'God' - if so, you could still ask, \"why did it not also say \"God.\" But rather, he means to say that it should have also said, 'the Lord' - as it says (later, Genesis 2:4), \"on the day that the Lord, God, made the earth and the heavens.\" And [so] he explains, \"Since, at first, etc.\" And one can also answer that it was difficult to Rashi; since behold, if the world was created with the trait of strict justice, 'it would be impossible [for it] to exist even one minute,' but rather He certainly created it with the trait of mercy - and, if so, why does it not say 'the Lord?\" (Nachalat Yakov) [Also,] it should have said, \"the Lord created,\" - which is the name of His essence, since His essence is mercy - and not [used] the name, God - which is a name that describes a judge - since He had not yet executed a judgment on earth. That is why he answers, \"it came up, etc.\"    ", 
                "And it is also possible that Rashi wanted to explain further, so that you should not ask: from where did he get it that it is because \"He saw that the world [would] not [be able to] exist [with the trait of strict justice, so] He... combined it, etc.;\" maybe it is because of another reason, since it is written (Psalms 89:3), \"the world will be built on kindness;\" or because of another reason?  And it is also difficult; why did He put the trait of mercy before the trait of strict justice? And it is about this that he said, \"concerning this is it written (Genesis 2:4), 'on the day that the Lord, God, made earth and heavens;'\" [as] it should have said, \"heavens and earth,\" like [it does with] \"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.\" But rather [the word order] is coming to teach that the [reason] that He combined the trait of mercy to the trait of strict justice is for the sake of the earth and its issue - since they cannot stand with the trait of strict justice. And for this reason did He have the earth go before the heavens and did He [also] have the trait of mercy go before the trait of strict justice. It is [to teach that it is] for the sake of the earth that the trait of kindness should overwhelm the trait of strict justice; which is not the case for the heavens, which can stand with the trait of strict justice.

                "It appears that Rashi holds that they are synonyms, meaning to say that both of them are expressions of desolation. Alternatively, he means to say that <i>reikut</i> is the language of Scripture (Hebrew) and <i>tsadya</i> is Aramaic, and both of them are expressions of emptiness; to [disagree with] the Translation [of Onkelos] that translates <i>tohu vabohu</i> as an expression of desolation and emptiness; which is why [Rashi] explains <i>bohu</i> to be an expression of  desolation and emptiness, and explained [only] <i>tohu</i> as an expression of wonder - that one wonders about desolation, which is to say about the desolation in it . And [according to that,] the [letter,] <i>vav</i>,  [in] <i>vabohu</i>, is [as if] it switches to a [letter,] bet, as in (Isaiah 49:16) \"The Lord sent me and His spirit (<i>verucho</i>),\" which is as if \"in His spirit.\"", 
                "He means to say that it should have [just] stated, \"upon the deep\" - what is [meant by] \"upon the face of [the deep]?\" But [rather] it is referring to the waters, which are upon the earth, and [so] they are the face of the earth. And this is why it is also written, \"and the spirit of God, etc.;\" as it was the darkness, since it is written earlier, \"and the darkness was on the face of the deep.\" And one can also say that his proof is that, since all of the ten proclamations of God here are a result of [the fact that] before them it was not like [what he would set into motion, and that] therefore it was required [for God] to say that this thing would be - for example, at first it wrote, \"In the beginning, etc.,\" which implies that there was only the earth alone and that there was nothing upon the earth; hence afterwards, it states, \"And God said let the earth bring forth.\" And if so, about that which is written, \"And God said, let there be light,\" one must say that before this proclamation, it was dark. And where does it say that it was dark? Perforce, you must say [that it is where it is written], \"and darkness was on the face of the deep\" - which was the waters, since the explanation of the deep in every place indicates the waters. We understand from this that the waters were upon the earth. And so [too] is it implied from the explanation of Rashi that \"let there be light\" refers to \"the darkness upon the face of the deep;\" since earlier he explained, \"In the beginning of the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the earth was chaos and void, and darkness was on the face of the deep, etc. and God said, 'let there be light.'\" Since he did not quote the entire verse - and he did not have to quote it all - it is implied that it refers to [the darkness that already existed]; since had it not been dark on the face [of the earth], He would not have decreed light to be upon it.",

And this is impossible; since if there is light, there is not darkness - as light and darkness are only a thing and its absence; and [so] their combination together  is not possible at any time (Nachalat Yakov). It is difficult; since how is it possible to explain that He established a boundary for this one during the day and a boundary for that one at night, etc.? And was not the separation not made until the fourth day; as it is written about it, \"to separate between the day and the night?\" Hence we need the words of the aggadah (homiletical teachings).",

For example, one hour it would be day and two hours it would be night, and afterwards, the opposite - and this is mishmash; but it is should not be explained that it is exactly at one time, since that is impossible as I explained above.

By way of illustration, at first one river was separated, and afterwards several parasangs [farther], the second river was separated, and so [too] all of them in this way.

And if you will ask, and behold in Parshat Ki Tetseh (Deuteronomy 21:12), Rashi explains that [it means that] she must grow them so that she becomes unseemly; [and so] we understand from this, that it is an expression of becoming unseemly and not one of [positive] arranging; one can answer that over there he means to say that it is unseemly for the woman, but, nonetheless, the growth is [positive] for the nail. And if so, it is good that he brings it as a proof that it is also an expression of arrangement. And also [it works as a proof], since it is [positive] for the woman; as behold, without this, she is forbidden to marry, but through becoming unseemly, she becomes permissible to marry (Nachalat Yakov). And to me it appears that it is not difficult and not anything, since everyone admits that the expression, making (<i>assia</i>), is [also] an expression of arrangement (or fixing) as the proof is brought in the Gemara (Yevamot 48a): \"Mefiboshet... did not make his feet and did not make his mustache\" (II Samuel 19:25).

It is fine that up until now, we would have thought that for this reason it did not state, \"it was good:\" since the work of the waters was not yet completed, since, behold the thing that the waters would rest upon was not yet created; but now that we hear they are suspended in the air, it comes out that the work of the water was already ended and finished - it is [hence] difficult; why is it not stated about [it], \"it was good.\" ",

And one can also answer, that this is not [called] making - since it did not change from what it was at first, but rather at first it was wet and on the second [day], it congealed; but it did not change from its appearance [and so] it is not relevant to say \"it was good.\" And if you will ask, it should have said, \"it was good\" three times on the third day: one for the completion of that day's work; one for the completion of the second day's work; and one for the completion of the work of the earth, as it is written, \"and the dry land appeared\" - and as Rashi explained nearby, that here it changed from what it was; one can answer that this is not called change, since the earth as it was at first is how it is now also - just, however, that it was not visible."
