                "It is proper for man to emulate his Creator, for then he will attain the secret of the Divine Form in both image and likeness. For if a person's physical form reflect the Divine Form, yet his actions do not, he falsifies his stature. People will say \"A handsome form whose deeds are ugly.\"  For the essential aspect of the Divine 'Form' and 'Likeness' is that they are the deeds of the Holy One, Blessed Be He. Therefore, what good is it for a person to reflect the Divine Form in a physical form only if his deeds do not imitate those of his creator? Thus, it is proper that man's action imitate the Thirteen Divine Attributes of Mercy- the function of the Sefirah of Keter- hinted at in these verses: \" Who is G-d like You, who forgives wickedness and forgives the transgression of the remaining of His heritage? He does not maintain His anger forever, for he delights in kindness. he will again show us compassion, He will destroy our wickedness, and You will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea. Show faithfulness to Ya'akov, kindness to Avraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from days of old\" (Michah 7:18-20) As a result, it is proper that these Thirteen Attributes, which we will now explain, should also be found in man.

                "\"And passes over transgression\" (Micah 7:18) This is a great a great quality, for behold, forgiveness is not through an emissary but rather through the hand of the Holy Blessed One, as it is written, \"For with you is forgiveness,\" (Psalm 130:4), forgiveness being that God washes away transgression, as it is written, \"When my lord will have washed away the filth of the daughters of Judah\" (Ezekiel 36:25), and so it us written, \"I will sprinkle upon you ritually pure waters.\" This is the meaning of \"And passes over transgression,\" sending forth from the waters of washing, and works, and washes away the sin. ", 
                "And behold, just like this, a human being needs to be, for they shall not say, \"And shall I fix what Joe Shmoe sinned or corrupted?\" They shall not say thus, for when someone sins, it is the Holy Blessed One,Godself--and not through an emissary--that God fixes the transgression and washes away the filth of their transgression. ", 
                "And from here, the person will be too ashamed to sin again, for behold, the Ruler, Godself washes their filthy clothes. "
