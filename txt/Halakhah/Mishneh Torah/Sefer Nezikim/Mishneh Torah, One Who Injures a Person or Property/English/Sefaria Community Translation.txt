Mishneh Torah, One Who Injures a Person or Property

Chapter 1

One who injures his friend is obligated to pay him for five items, and they are: damage, pain, healing, loss of work, and embarrassment. And these five iterms are all paid for from the best of his property, as is the law for all damagers.
