Mishnah Megillah

Chapter 1

The <i>Megillah</i> [Scroll of Esther] is read on the eleventh, on the twelfth, on the thirteenth, on the fourteenth, [or] on the fifteenth [of Adar], not earlier and not later. Cities surrounded with walls from the days of Yehoshua son of Nun read it on the fifteenth [of Adar]. Villages and large cities read it on the fourteenth, but villages read in advance on the day of assembly.
How does it work?  If the fourteenth of the month fell on a Monday, villages and large cities read on that day, and those surrounded by a wall - on the next day.  If it fell on a Tuesday or a Wednesday - villages [read] in advance on the day of assembly, and large cities read on that day, and those surrounded by a wall - on the next day.  If it fell on a Thursday, villages and large cities read on that day, and those surrounded by a wall - on the next day. If it fell on the day before Shabbat - villages [read] in advance on the day of assembly, and large cities and cities surrounded by a wall read on that day.  If it fell on Shabbat, villages and large cities read in advance on the day of assembly, and those surrounded by a wall - on the next day.  If it fell after Shabbat, villages [read] in advance on the assembly day, and large cities read on that day, and cities surrounded by a wall - on the next day.
What kind of city is considered large? Any in which there are ten idle men. Any less than that, it is considered a village. Concerning these [laws, the rabbis] said: "We may do so in advance but not delay." But the time of [delivery of] wood for the priests, and [the fast of] the 9th of Av, and the festival offering, and <i>hakhel</i> [the national gathering at the Temple on Sukkot after the Sabbatical year to hear the king read the Torah] may be delayed but not done in advance. And even though they said [in respect to the reading of the Megillah] that it may be done in advance, it is still permitted [before the fourteenth of Adar, even when the Megillah is read,] to eulogize, to fast, and to give gifts to the poor. Rabbi Yehudah said: In what situation [are these alternative dates valid]? In places where they in fact assemble on Monday and Thursday. But in a place where they do not assemble, neither on Monday nor on Thursday, they can only read it at its ordained time.
If the <i>Megillah</i> was read in first of Adar, and the year was [subsequently] intercalated, we read it in second of Adar. There is no difference between the first Adar and the second Adar except the reading of the <i>Megillah</i> and alms to the poor.
There is no difference between a festival day and Shabbat except <i>okhel nefesh</i> (the law allowing one to do certain types of food preparation on festivals). There is no difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur except that the willful violation of [Shabbat] is [punishable] by man, and the willful violation of [Yom Kippur] is [punishable] by <i>karet</i> [Divinely imposed punishment consisting in severance from Heaven and/or the Jewish people].
There is no difference between one who disavows any benefit from his fellow and one who disavows [accepting] any food from him except setting foot [in his house] and [borrowing] vessels that are not used for <i>okhel nefesh</i>. There is no difference between vow-offerings and voluntary offerings except that one is obligated to fulfill his vow-offerings [regardless of whether the original animal can be brought], and one is not obligated to fulfill voluntary offerings [if the original animal cannot be brought].
There is no difference between a <i>zav</i> [a male who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, which render him impure] who has seen two sightings and one who has seen three except an offering. There is no difference between a [possible] <i>metzorah</i> [one rendered severely impure from an unsightly skin disease. Upon recovery and purification, he must bring offerings] who has been sequestered [in order to ascertain his status] and one who has been definitively declared a <i>metzorah</i> except rent clothes and unkempt hair. There is no difference between one who was declared pure after being sequestered [in order to ascertain his status] and one who was declared pure after being definitively declared [a <i>metzorah</i>] except shaving and [the offering of] birds.
There is no difference between <i>sefarim</i> [scrolls containing the Torah, Prophets, or Writings that were used for ceremonial readings] and <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzot</i> except that <i>sefarim</i> may be written in any language, while <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzot</i> may only be written in <i>ashurit</i> [in the Hebrew language using a particular set of glyphs]. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "Even concerning <i>sefarim</i>, they only permitted them to be written in Greek."
