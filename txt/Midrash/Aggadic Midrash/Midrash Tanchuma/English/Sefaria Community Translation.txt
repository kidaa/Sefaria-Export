Book 1



Parshah 1

<b>In the beginning God created.</b> This is per the verse (Prov. 3:19): "God with wisdom founded the earth" and when the Holy One Blessed Be He created His world, he consulted the Torah and created His World, as it says (Prov. 8:14) "I have counsel and sound wisdom, I am understanding, I have strength." And with what was the Torah written? With black flame on white flame, as it is said (Song of Songs 5:11) "his hair is wavy, black as a raven." What is meant by קוצותיו תלתלים ("his hair is wavy")? That on every קוצ (thorn)^(that is, every serif of every letter of the Torah) hang  תילי תילים (locks and locks) of laws. How so? It is written in it [the Torah] (Lev. 22:32): And do not desecrate [תחללו] My holy Name. If you change the [ח] to a [ה] you destroy the world ^(by making techalelu into tehalelu, and making the verse mean do not praise My holy Name). "Every soul shall praise [תהלל] God" (Psalms 150:6), if you change the [ה] a [ח] ^(techalel - shall desecrate) you destroy the world. Likewise, (Deut. 6:4) "Hear O'Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One [אחד]." If you change the [ד] to a [ר] you destroy the world, as it is said (Exo. 34:14) "You will not bow down to other gods." [Elsewhere it is stated] (Jer. 5:12) "They have belied Hashem."  If you change the [ב] to a [כ] you destroy the world. [Elsewhere it is stated] (Shmuel I 2:2) "There is none holy as Hashem."  If you change the [כ] to a [ב] you destroy the world. And if just a letter is like this, how much more so a whole word. For this is it stated, "his locks are like tresses." Therefore Dovid praised and said, (Psalms 119:96) "Your commandment is exceedingly broad." [Likewise] it is said (Iyov 11:9) "the measure thereof is longer than the earth..." And it [the Torah] was the guide for all creation, as it is said (Prov. 8:30) "then I was by Him, as a nursling." Do not read it as אמון [nurseling], but rather as אומן [guide].








<b>Behold, Thou has driven me out..., Hashem said unto him, "Therefore whosoever slayeth Kayin ..."</b> There are those that say He closed the Shabbos before him, as it is said (Exo. 31:17) "a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever." Just like Shabbos found worthiness in Adam, the first [man], so too did it find worthiness in Kayin. And there are those that say a horn was affixed to his [Kayin's] forehead. When Kayin killed Hevel, [Hevel] was discarded [on the ground] and Kayin did not know what to do. So the Holy One, Blessed is He, sent him two pure birds and one of them killed his fellow, and then dug the earth with its claws and buried it [the dead bird]. From this Kayin learned and dug and buried Hevel. Therefore, the birds have merited that their blood be covered [with earth].

Parshah 2









...R. Levi said: The whole twelve months that Noah was in the ark, neither he nor his family tasted sleep because they were responsible for feeding the beasts, animals and birds. R. Akiva said: Even branches for the elephants, and little shards of glass for the ostriches, they brought it with their hands to feed them. Now some animals ate in the second hour of the night and some in the third hour of the day, hence you know that Noah did not taste a bit of sleep. R. Yochanan said: One time, when Noah was late in feeding the lion, the lion attacked him, and he went away limping...

Our sages teach us, "Who is the guarantor who is responsible for repayment [of a loan]?"  Thus taught our sages:  Rabbi Shimon ben Nanas says, "Who is the guarantor that is responsible for repayment?  The one who says lend him and I will give it to you." When he takes and places it in the hand of the guarantor, he is responsible.  And who was this guarantor?  This was Judah, as he said, '''Send him with me and I will return him to you.'  And he said, 'My son will not go down with you...If harm occurs to him.....'(Genesis 42:37-8)."  From here you learn that one who goes out on the way, Satan accuses him.  Rabbi Yossi ben Chanina says that we learn that women die at the time of childbirth because of three transgressions.  Why at the time of childbirth?  Because Satan accuses at the time of danger.  Benjamin descended with his brothers and they took corn. Joseph commanded and he put the goblet in his sack.  Before they had gone far, he sent after them.  He said to them, 'How could you do such an evil thing?' He said, "Whoever is found to have the goblet in his hand will be my slave.'  When it was found in the sack of Benjamin, each one of them turned his face away and who stood against him?  The guarantor.  "And Judah came near (Genesis 44:18)."

Midrash Tanchuma Ki Tetze 3
(3) [23,10] “When a camp goes out against your enemies, you shall beware of everything evil.” (Devarim 23:10) There should be no levity among you so that you do not incur any liability. From whom should you learn? From Yiftach. What is written about him? “…and he was the son of a harlot…” (Shoftim 11:1) R’ Shimon ben Gamliel said that she brought her sister-wife into her house, and our Rabbis say that she was really a harlot, and because there was some levity in him all of the people fell upon him. Therefore it is written ‘you shall beware of everything evil’ and ‘If there is among you a man who is unclean…’ These are Israel who became impure through idolatry, as it says “…scatter them afar like a menstruant; 'Go out,' say to it.” (Yeshayahu 30:22) “…he shall go outside the camp…” (Devarim 23:11) that they were exiled to Bavel. “And it shall be, towards evening…”(Devarim 23:12) the evening of the kingdoms, and the Holy One purifies them as it says “…he shall bathe in water…” (ibid.) and it is written “When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion…” (Yeshayahu 4:4) “…and when the sun sets…” (Devraim 23:12) When the King Messiah comes of whom it is written “…and his throne is like the sun before Me.” (Tehillim 89:37) “…he may come within the camp” (Devarim 23:12) These are Israel, entering intp the Holy Temple. “And you shall have a designated place outside the camp…” (Devarim 23:13) this is the merit of Avraham. R’ Pinchas said- “…so that you can go out there,” to Bavel. “And you shall keep a stake in addition to your weapons…” (Devarim 23:14) Nevuchadnezar demanded that they serve an idol and they said “…let it be known to you, O king, that we will not worship your god…” (Daniel 3:18) “…and you shall return and cover your excrement.” (Devarim 23:14) The covering of idolatry that was in Jerusalem. “For the Lord, your God, goes along in the midst of your camp…” (Devarim 23:15) The Holy One will be revealed to them immediately and saved them from the fire. “Therefore, your camp shall be holy…” (ibid.) Afterwards He will sanctify them as it says “And they shall call them the holy people, those redeemed by the Lord…” (Yeshayahu 62:12)

Parshah 1


Let our rabbis teach us: one who passes before the ark [i.e., serves as precentor for the 'amidah] and errs by not mentioning the birkat haminim--from whence do we know that we make him repeat the prayer? That is what the rabbis taught: One who passes before the ark and errs in any or all of the blessings, we do not make him repeat the prayer. But if he errs in the birkat haminim, we make him repeat and recite it against his will. And why do we make him repeat it? We are concerned lest he is a min, for if he has some aspect of minut, he will curse himself and the congregation will answer "amen."

<b>And on the eigth day you shall circumcise</b> It doesn't say here to make parties about the circumcision. Come and see how much Israel loves the commandments, that they make parties in order to observe the commandments and to have joy in them. The Holy One, Blessed is He says "you guard the commandments and celebrate them, I will increase joy for you", as it says (Isaiah 29:19) "The humble also shall increase their joy in the LORD..." [Beloved is circumcision, for The Holy One Blessed is He swore to Abraham that all who are circumcised will not descend to <i>Gehenom</i>, as it says (Genesis 15:18) "In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying...", and who descended to there? See what is says next (Genesis 15:19) "the Kenite, and the Kenizzite...". And so did Ezekiel see, as it says (Ezekiel 32:18-30) "Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, with the daughters of the mighty nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. Whom dost thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised... Asshur is there and all her company; their graves...  There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised... There are the princes of the north...". And so did Isaiah say (Isaiah 5:14) "Therefore the nether-world hath enlarged her desire, And opened her mouth without measure" — to he that doesn't have a statute [the words לבלי חק — "without measure" — can also be rendered "to he that doesn't have the statute"], and where [do we see that] it [the commandment to circumcise] is called a statue? As it says (Psalms 105:10) "And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant", because the Holy One Blessed is He placed His name with Israel. And what is the name and the seal that he placed in them? It is <i>Shaddai</i> [שדי], the <i>shin</i> [ש] is placed on the nose, the <i>dalet</i> [ד] on the hand, and the <i>yud</i> [י] on the [location of the] circumcision. Therefore when he goes to his eternal home, there is an angel appointed in the Garden of Eden who takes him and brings him into the Garden of Eden. And regarding the heretics and sinners, The Holy One Blessed is He commands the angel to pull his foreskin [i.e. reverse his circumcision], as it says (Psalms 55:21) "He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; He hath profaned his covenant."]. It once happened that the evil Turnus Rufus asked Rabbi Akiva, "which are the greater works, those of the Holy One Blessed is He or those of flesh and blood?" He said to him, "Those of flesh and blood are greater." Turnus Rufus said, "But the Heavens and Earth — is Man able to make such as those?" Rabbi Akiva said to him, "Don't speak to me about something which is beyond Man, which he has no mastery over, rather speak of things which are found among people." He said, "Why do you circumcise?" He replied, "I knew you were going to ask me about that, which is why I started by telling you that the works of Man are better than the works of the Holy One Blessed is He." Rabbi Akiva brought him stalks [of grain] and loaves [of bread]. He said to him, "These are the works of the Holy One Blessed is He, and these are the works of Man." He said, "Those are no better than than the stalks.' Turnus Rufus [then] said to him, "If He wants circumcision, why does the infant not emerge circumcised from his mother's womb?" Rabbi Akiva said to him ,"And why does his umbilical chord emerge with him, [so] he hangs from the belly, and his mother [has to] cut it? And this that you said 'Why doesn't he emerge circumcised?', [the reason is] because the Holy One Blessed is He gave the Israel the commandments only in order to refine them [Israel] through them [the commandments].  And that's why David said (Psalms 18:31) (all) 'the word of the LORD is refined.'"

Another interpretation: Why was [the Torah] given in the desert? Because if it were given in the Land, the tribe in whose area it was given would have said: I am most important. Therefore, it was given in the desert. Another reason it was given in the desert: Just like the desert is not planted and worked, so to is it with the one who accepts Torah upon himself. The yoke of rulership and the yoke of the ways of the world are removed from him. And just like the desert doesn't incur agricultural taxes, so to, men of Torah are are free men in this world. Another interpretation: Who fulfills the Torah? He who makes himself like a desert and detaches himself from everything.

(7) "And they came near the daughters of Zelophehad." (Numbers 27:1) -  During this generation women were fencing in that on which men were breaking down fences. Thus you find Aaron told them, "Break off the gold rings" (Exodus 32:2), and the women did not want to and they protested against their husbands, as it says, "and all the nation broke off the golden rings which were in their ears" (Exodus 32:3), and women did not participate in the incident of the calf.  And so too, in the incident of the spies, [the women] did not participate "and when [the spies] returned, they caused all the congregation to murmur against [Moses]" (Numbers 14:36), and they decreed a decree, as they said, "we can not go up" (Numbers 13:31), but the women were not in agreement with them, just as is written above regarding the matter: "because God had said of them: 'they will surely die in the wilderness' and there was not left of them a man" (Numbers 26:65) - "a man" and not a woman, for they did not want to enter to the Land, but the women became close by seeking a portion in the Land. And thus this episode was written next to [the death of Miriam], from which the men broke down fences and women erected fences.
