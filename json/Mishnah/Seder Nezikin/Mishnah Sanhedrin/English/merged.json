[Suits for] damages or half-damages, [crimes for which one would] pay double, or pay quadruple or quintuple, [are judged] by three [judges]. [Cases of] rape, seduction, and slander [are judged] by three [judges]- these are the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, [a case of] slander [is judged] by twenty-three [judges], because this is a capital case.", 
            "[Cases regarding transgressions punishable by] lashing, by three. In the name of Rabbi Yishmael it was said, by twenty-three. Intercalating the month by three; intercalating the year, by three, these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says, They begin with three, deliberate with five, and finish with seven. But if they finish with three, [the year] has been intercalated.",

Fourth year produce or the second tithe with unknown value, by three. [Redemption of] dedications [for the Temple], by three. Valuations of chattel, by three.

The wolf and the lion, the bear and the tiger, the leopard and the snake, are put to death by twenty-three.

From where [do we derive] that the great [Sanhedrin] [comprises] seventy-one [judges]? As it says, (Numbers 11:16) \"gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel,\" and Moses [set] over them, behold, [the number of judges adds to] seventy-one. Rabbi Yehudah says: seventy. And from where [do we derive] that a small [Sanhedrin] [comprises] twenty-three [judges]? As it says, (Numbers 35:24-25) \"the assembly shall judge... the assembly shall deliver.\" The assembly judges and the assembly delivers- behold  [the number of judges adds to] twenty. From where [do we derive] that the assembly is ten? As it says, (Numbers 14:27) \"Until when shall I bear this wicked assembly.\" This excludes Joshua and Caleb. And from where [do we derive that we] add three more? This is implied by the [verse], as it says, (Exodus 23:2) \"Do not follow the many to do evil.\" Should I learn to follow them to do good? If so, why does it say (Exodus 23:2) \"Following the many to distort [justice]\" - your following to do good is not like your following to do evil. Following to do good [i.e. acquittal] is by one, following to do evil [i.e. conviction] is by two. Since a court cannot [contain an] even [number of members], we add [to the number of judges] one more- behold this is twenty-three. And how many [inhabitants] must a city have before it may have a Sanhedrin? One hundred and twenty. Rabbi Nechemiah says, two hundred and thirty, [each judge] corresponding to a chief of a group of ten."

These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehudah says, he may not leave from the Temple, as it says, (Leviticus 21:12) \"And from the Temple, he may not leave.\" When he comforts other [mourners], it is the custom that all the people pass by one after one, and the appointed [substitute High Priest] interposes himself between [the High Priest] and the people.

Rabbi Yehudah says, if he wishes to perform <i>chalitzah</i> or marry through Levirate marriage, he is remembered for good [i.e. it is meritorious].

And everything that the nation plunders, they place in front of him, and he takes the first portion. \"He may not amass too many wives\" (Deuteronomy 17:17), only eighteen. Rabbi Yehudah says, he may amass more, so long as they do not lead his heart astray. Rabbi Shimon says, even one who leads his heart astray he may not marry. If so, why does it say, (Deuteronomy 17:17) \"He may not amass too many wives\"? [This condition applies even if she is] like Abigail. \"He may not amass too many horses\" (Deuteronomy 17:16), only enough for his chariots. \"And excessive silver and gold he may not amass\" (Deuteronomy 17:17), only enough to pay his soldiers' wages. He must write a Torah scroll for himself. [When] he goes to war, he takes it out with him. [When] he enters, he brings it with him. [When] he sits in judgment, it is with him.

Rabbi Yehudah says, when [are these invalid]? When they have no other trade; but when they have another trade, they are acceptable.",

Rabbi Yose said, this is the teaching of Rabbi Akiva. But the original teaching [said]: his uncle, and the son of his uncle, all his potential heirs, and anyone related to him at that time. One who used to be related to him but is no longer- behold, he is acceptable. Rabbi Yehudah says, even if his daughter dies, and [his son-in-law] had children with her- behold, [the daughter's widowed husband] is a relation.",

Then they would send every man outside, but keep the eldest among them and say to him: \"Say how you know that the one owes the other.\" If he says, \"He told me, 'I owe him,'\" or, \"So-and-so told me that he owes him\" - this means nothing. Only if he says, \"In front of us, he told him that he owes him two hundred <i>zuz</i>\" [is his testimony meaningful]. After this, they would bring in the second [witness] and examine him. If they find that their words are aligned, [the judges] deliberate on the matter. [If] two say innocent and one says guilty, [the verdict is] innocent. Two say guilty and one says innocent, [the verdict is] guilty. One says innocent and one says guilty, or even if the two acquit or the two convict and one says he does not know, they add [more] judges.",

            "Each time [a litigant] brings evidence [anew], he overturns the [previous] verdict. [If] they said to him: \"All evidence that you have, bring it here within thirty days.\" If he finds [evidence] within thirty days, it overturns [the previous verdict]. After thirty days, it does not overturn. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what could he have done, for he did not find [evidence] within thirty days, but [only] after thirty days! [If] they said to him, \"Bring witnesses,\" and he says, \"I have no witnesses\"; [or] they say to him, \"Bring evidence,\" and he says, \"I have no evidence\"; and after a time he brings evidence or finds witnesses, behold this means nothing. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what could he have done, for he did not know that he had witnesses and [only later] found witnesses, [or] he did not know that he had evidence and [only later] found evidence! [If] they said to him, \"Bring witnesses\" and he says, \"I have no witnesses\"; or [they say,] \"Bring evidence,\" and he says, \"I have no evidence\"; and he sees that he will be convicted and says, \"Come near so-and-so and so-and-so, and testify for me,\" or he found evidence from his wallet, behold this means nothing."

            "Both cases of money (non-capital) and cases of life (capital) have examination and inquiry, as it is written (Leviticus 24:22) \"You shall have one justice.\" What is the difference between cases of money and cases of life: Cases of money [are tried] with three [judges], and cases of life, with twenty-three. Cases of money are opened either [with arguments] to acquit or to convict, and cases of life open [with arguments] to acquit but do not open [with arguments] to convict. Cases of money are decided by one either to acquit or to convict; cases of life are decided by one to acquit or by two to convict. Cases of money, [the verdict] can change between acquittal and conviction; cases of life can change to acquittal but cannot change to conviction. Cases of money, all can rule for acquittal or conviction; cases of life, all can rule for acquittal but all cannot rule for conviction. Cases of money, one who convicts can acquit and one who acquits can convict; in cases of life, one who convicts can acquit, but one who acquits cannot turn and convict. Cases of money can be tried in the day and can finish in the night; cases of life are tried in the day and must finish in the day. Cases of money finish on the same day for either acquittal or conviction; cases of life finish on the same day for acquittal and the next day for conviction, therefore there cannot be trials on Friday evening or the evening before a holiday.",

We bring them in [to the court's chambers] and press them: \"Perhaps what you say [isn't eyewitness testimony] is but your own assessment, or from rumors, or your witnessing an actual witness testify, or your reporting what a trustworthy said. Or perhaps you were unaware that by the end we'd interrogate you, with examination and inquiry. Know that capital cases are not like monetary ones. In monetary cases, [a false witness] can return the money and achieve atonement. But in capital cases, the blood of [the victim [and all his future offspring hang upon you until the end of time. For thus we find in regard to Cain, who killed his brother, \"The bloods of your brother scream out!\" (Genesis 4:10) - the verse does not say blood of your brother, but bloods of your brother, because it was his blood and also the blood of his future offspring [screaming out]! [Another explanation of the verse: for his blood was splattered over the trees and rocks  [there was more than one pool of blood]. [The judges' speech continues] \"It was for this reason that man was first created as one person [Adam], to teach you that anyone who destroys a life  is considered by Scripture to have destroyed an entire world; any any who saves a life is as if he saved an entire world.\" And also, to promote peace among the creations, that no man would say to his friend, \"My ancestors are greater than yours.\" And also, so that heretics will not say, \"there are many rulers up in Heaven.\" And also, to express the grandeur of The Holy One [blessed be He]: For a man strikes many coins from the same die, and all the coins are alike. But the King, the King of Kings, The Holy One [blessed be He] strikes every man from the die of the First Man, and yet no man is quite like his friend.] [The judges' speech continues:] \"Maybe you [the witnesses] will now say, 'What do we need this, and all this anxiety for [let's not come forward even with true testimony]!' But Scripture has lready spoken: \"If he be a witness - having seen or known - if he does not express it, he shall bear his sin.\" (Lev. 5:1) Maybe you will now say, 'What do we need this, to be responsible for another man's death?'

            "Four [forms] of capital punishment were given over to the courts: stoning, burning, decapitation, and strangulation. Rabbi Shimon says, burning, stoning, strangulation, and decapitation. This is the law [i.e. procedure] concerning those to be stoned.", 
            "The law [i.e. procedure] concerning those to be burned [is as follows]:  They would set him into manure up to his knees, and put a stiff scarf inside a soft one, and wrap it around his neck. One would pull [one end] towards him and one would pull [the other end] towards him, until he [who was being executed] opened his mouth. Then [one] would light a wick and throw it into his mouth, and it would descend into his bowels and burn his entrails.  Rabbi Yehudah says, if he died by their hands [e.g. were he strangled by the cloth], they would not have fulfilled the commandment of [execution by] burning; rather [the procedure should be carried out as follows]: they open his mouth with pincers by force, and light the wick, and throw it into his mouth, and it would descend into his bowels and burn his entrails. Rabbi Eliezer ben Tzadok said, there was once a priest's daughter who committed adultery; they placed bundles of branches around her and burned her. The [Sages] said to him, [this happened] because the court at that time was not expert.",

Rabbi Yehudah says, this is disgraceful; rather [the procedure should be carried out as follows]: they rest his head on a block and cut it with a hatchet. The [Sages] said to him, there is no death more disgraceful than that.

One who sleeps with his mother - [he] is liable [for violating two prohibitions, for the prohibition of sleeping with his] mother and for [the prohibition of sleeping with] his father's wife. Rabbi Yehudah says, he is only liable for [sleeping with] his mother.

Rather, since [the animal] caused a person to commit an offense, Scripture therefore said, [the animal] should be stoned. Another explanation: [the animal is stoned] so that the animal not be passing through the market-place and [lead people to] say, \"This is the one that caused so-and-so to be stoned.\"",

Rather, [the judges] send everyone outside, and inquire of the greatest [witness] among them, saying to him: \"State explicitly what you heard,\" and he states [the blasphemy verbatim].

One who takes a vow in its name or takes an oath in its name [merely] transgresses a negative commandment [that does not warrant capital punishment].

A <i>ba'al 'ov</i>- this is the magician who [causes the dead] to speak from his armpit; a <i>yid'oni</i>- this is the one who [causes the dead] to speak through his own mouth. These are executed by stoning, and one who consults them is [merely liable for] a negative commandment [that does not warrant capital punishment].", 
            "One who desecrates the Sabbath- through an act for which a wanton violation renders him liable to spiritual excision, and a violation in error obligates him [to sacrifice] a sin-offering. One who curses his mother or father- he is not liable unless he curses them using the name [of God]. If he curses them using a substitute name, Rabbi Meir [maintains he is] liable, but the Sages exempt him.",

If he said [i.e. enticed] to two, they are his witnesses, and they bring him to court and stone him. If he said to one, [the witness] says, \"I have friends who are interested.\" If [the <i>mesit</i>] is cunning and cannot speak before them, they conceal witnesses behind the fence, and [the original witness] says to [the <i>mesit</i>], \"Say [again] what you said to me in seclusion.\" [If] this one [the <i>mesit</i>] says it to him, [the witness] says, \"How can we forsake our God in Heaven and go and worship wood and stone!\" If [the <i>mesit</i>] retracts, all is good [i.e. he is not culpable]. [But] if he says, \"This is our obligation and this is good for us,\" those standing behind the fence bring him to court and stone him. One who says [any of the following is liable as a <i>mesit</i>:], \"I will serve\"; \"I will go and I will serve\"; \"we will go and we will serve\"; \"I will sacrifice\"; \"I will go and I will sacrifice\"; \"we will go and we will sacrifice\"; \"I will offer incense\"; \"I will go and I will offer incense\"; \"we will go and we will offer incense\"; \"I will pour libations\"; \"I will go and I will pour libations\"; \"we will go and we will pour libations,\" \"I will bow\"; \"I will go and I will bow\"; \"we will go and we will bow.\" The <i>mediach</i>- this is one who says, \"We will go and we will worship idols.\"",

            "They do not execute him in his city's court or in the court at Yavneh; rather, they bring him up to the Great Court in Jerusalem, and they guard him until the festival, and they execute him on the festival, as it says, (Deuteronomy 17:13) \"And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously,\" according to Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehudah says, they do not delay the judgment of this one; rather, they execute him immediately, and they write and send messengers to every place [with the following message]: \"This man so-and-so son of that man so-and-so was liable to execution by the court. ", 
            "A false prophet— [one who] prophesies regarding that which he did not hear and that which was not said to him, his death is by man [i.e. the court is empowered to execute him]. But one who suppresses his prophecy, and one who disregards the words of a prophet, and a prophet who transgressed his own words, his death is by Heaven [i.e. the court is not empowered to execute him], as it says, (Deuteronomy 18:19) \"I will require it of him.\"", 
            "One who prophesies in the name of an idol— [this is] one who says \"thus said the idol,\" even if he directed his instruction to render the impure impure and the pure pure. An adulterer—once she has entered the domain of her husband through <i>nisu'in</i> [complete marriage, as opposed to only <i>erusin</i>, betrothal], even though [her husband] has not slept with her, [another] who sleeps with her is [executed] by strangulation. [Witnesses] who scheme against a priest's daughter and the one who sleeps with her—since all scheming [witnesses] receive the same form of execution [as that incurred by the prohibition which they have schemed to falsely accuse another of transgressing], except for [witnesses] who scheme against a priest's daughter and the one who sleeps with her.
