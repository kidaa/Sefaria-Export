Mishneh Torah, Leavened and Unleavened Bread

Chapter 1

Anyone who eats an olive's volume of leavened bread on Passover beginning on the night of the 15th until the end of the 21st of Nissan  intentionally is obligated to [a punishment of] kareit/cutting off, as it was said, "For anyone who eats leavened bread and will be cut off" (Exodus 12:15). Unintentionally - one is obligated to a sacrifice of a fixed type (i.e. non-sliding scale) of sin-offering. This is [the same for] one who eats [it] and one who liquifies and drinks [it].


Chametz which passed over Passover [under Jewish ownership] is forbidden to derive benefit from forever. This is a penalty imposed by the Rabbis on the Jew who violated [the prohibition of] "thou shalt not see nor shall it be found" so they forbade it even if he left it accidentally or under unavoidable circumstances so that no one would keep chametz around on Passover in order to use afterwards.

Chapter 7






In every generation, a person is obligated to show himself as if he himself went out now from the enslavement in Egypt, as it says, (Deuteronomy 6:23) "And He brought us out from there..." And regarding this the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded in the Torah, (Deuteronomy 24:18) "And you shall remember that you were a slave...", meaning "as if" you yourself were a slave and were taken out to freedom and were redeemed.

Chapter 8


Begin with the blessing "who brought forth from the ground" and take a vegetable and dip it in charoset and eat a kazait, he and everyone reclining with him should not eat less than a kazait. Afterwards, take away the table from in front of him and he reads the hagaddah to himself. Mix the second cup, and here the son asks. Why is this night different from all other night? On all other nights we don't dip even once, tonight twice. On all other nights we eat hametz and matzah, tonight only matzah. On all other nights we eat meat roasted, boiled, or cooked, tonight only roasted. On all other nights we eat all kinds of vegetables, tonight only maror. On all other nights we eat while sitting or reclining, tonight we all recline.
In today's times we don't say "tonight only roasted" because we don't have a [pascal] sacrifice. Begin with shame and read until completion of the entire section "arami oved avi".
