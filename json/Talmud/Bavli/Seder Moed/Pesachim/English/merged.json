            "R. Joshua b. Levi said: \"A man should never bring forth from his mouth an unfit word, for the Scripture uses a circumlocution of eight [extra] letters in order to avoid an ugly word; for it is said (Gen. 4:2) Of the clean beasts and of the beasts that are not clean.\" R. Papa said: \"A circumlocution of nine letters is found in the Scripture; for it is said (Deu. 23:11) If there be among thee, any man that is not lean.\" Rabina said : \"Ten letters [is the circumlocution]; for in the same text there is an an extra letter, Vav.\" R. Acha b. Jacob said: \"Sixteen extra letters are used [in order to avoid an unfit word], as it is said (I Sam. 20:26) For he thought something hath befallen him, he is not clean, because he has not yet purified himself [in order to avoid the word impure].\" At the academy of R. Ishmael, it was taught that a man should always speak in clean language, since the seat of a male zab the passage calls (Lev. 15:9) saddle, and the seat of a female zab the passage calls (Ib.) sitting place. This principle is also supported by the following passage (Job 15:6 ) So that thou choosest the language of the prudent. Also by another passage (Ib. 33, 3) And my lips utter knowledge clearly. Why does he cite all these passages [is not the first one sufficient] ? You will perhaps say that this applies only to Biblical matters, but for Rabbinical matters any language might be used. Come, listen; it is said, So that thou choosest a language of the prudent. And if you will say that this applies only to Rabbinical matters, but for secular affairs any language might be used : Come, Listen to this passage : And my lips utter knowledge clearly."

            "There were two disciples sitting before Hillel, of whom one was R. Jochanan b. Zakai. According to others, these disciples were sitting before Rabbi, and one of them was R. Jochanan. One said [while studying a Mishnah]: \"Why must the grapes be cut according to the rules of levital cleanliness, while olives may be gathered even according to the rules of levitical defilement?\" The other pupil said: \"Why must the grapes be cut under the rules of levitical cleanliness, while the gathering of olives need not be made under the rules of levitical cleanliness?\" \"I am sure,\" remarked their teacher, \"that this one [who used becoming words] will become a judge in Israel.\" It is said that before many days had elapsed he became a judge in Israel.  There were three priests [discussing the portions of their priestly gifts]; one said: \"Mine was as large as a bean.\" To this the other responded: \"Mine, was as large as an olive.\" The third one said: \"Mine was as large as the tail of a lizard.\" In consequence of that unfit expression, the last was examined as to his fitness to serve upon the altar and they found in him a blemish of descent. Have we not been taught [in a Mishnah] ''No family records are searched beyond the altar\"? [for he was certainly examined before he began serving upon it; hence how was this examination possible?] Do not say a \"blemish of descent,\" but say [they found in him] \"obscenity which made him unworthy of the priesthood.\" And if you please, you may say this instance differs, because he harmed himself by causing the investigation].",

He said: It is written, no stranger [i.e. gentile] should eat from it; no uncircumcised person shall eat from it, but I eat of the very best. R. Judah b. Bathyra said to him: Did they give you a piece from the fatty tail? No, he replied. When you go there tell them to give you some of the tail. When he went up he said to them, Give me from the fatty tail. They said to him: The fatty tail is sacrificed on the altar.  They said to him: Who told you to do this? He said: R. Judah b. Bathyra. They said: What's going on? They did a background check and discovered that he was a gentile and killed him. Then they sent a message to R. Judah b. Bathyra: Peace be with you, R. Judah b. Bathyra, for you are in Netzivin but your net is spread in Jerusalem.",

            "R. Elazar said: \"Those who go on a religious mission, will not meet with evil either going to, or from, their duty.\" R. Elazar was in accord with the opinion of the Tanna, Issi b. Juda, who taught: \"Since the Torah says (Exodus 34:24) ‘Yet shall no man desire thy land,’ it is to be implied that the cow shall feed in the pasture and no beast shall harm it, the chicken shall dig in the rubbish and no weasel shall harm it.\" Now, can this not be inferred a fortiori? If, regarding the things which are exposed to injury, it is promised that no harm will occur, how much the more so regarding things that are usually not exposed to injury? This conclusion I could only arrive at with reference to protection while on the way to perform [a meritorious act]. Whence, however, do we infer that even on the return, no harm will occur? It is said (Deuteronomy 16:7) ‘And thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents.’ From this passage we may learn that Thou wilt go and find thy tents in peace. Since even on the return [he will meet no evil], wherefore is it necessary to mention [the protection] on the way going to perform the religious duty? We must therefore say this statement is necessary for the reference to what R. Ami said: \"Every man who has land is in duty bound to visit Jerusalem during the festivals, but a man who has no land need not visit Jerusalem during the festivals.\" R. Abin b. R. Adda said in the name of R. Isaac: \"Why was there not Gennesar-fruit in the land of Israel? Lest those who visit Jerusalem during the festivals should say, 'Had we come here merely to enjoy of the Gennesar-fruit: it would have been sufficient.' Hence their visit would become not as a matter of duty.\" The same said R. Dastoe b. Janai: \"Why are not the hot springs of Tiberias located in Jerusalem? For the simple reason that those who visit Jerusalem during the festivals, should not say, 'Were it for nothing else than to bathe ourselves in the hot springs of Tiberias that we visited Jerusalem, it would have been sufficient! Thus their visiting Jerusalem would turn out to be not as a matter of duty.\" \n"

            "R. Jacob said in the name of R. Jochanan: \"By every means, one may cure himself except by means of the tree devoted to idolatry.\" To what case does he refer? If we assume that he refers to a case where there is fear of danger, then why not cure by means of the tree devoted to idolatry? But if he refers to a case in which there is no fear of danger, then one is prohibited to be cured by means of any prohibited articles. Indeed, he does refer to a case where there is fear of danger, nevertheless it is forbidden [to be cured] by means of a tree devoted to ideolatry. As we are taught in a Baraitha, R. Eliezer says: \"Since it is said (Deuteronomy 6:5) [Thou shalt love thy God] with all thy soul, wherefore is added, With all thy wealth? And since it is said, With all thy wealtlh, wherefore is also added, With all thy soul? This is to teach us that in case there is a man who loves himself more than his wealth, for him it is said, With all thy soul. And if there is a man who loves his wealth more than himself, for him it is said, With all thy wealth."

            "Gemara: Why deal [specifically] with \"eves of Pesachs\"? Even the eves of Sabbaths and Festivals also [one may not eat from close to Mincha until nightfall], as it is taught [in a Baraita], \"One may not eat on the eves of Sabbatahs and Festivals from Mincha and on, so that one can enter the Sabbath with an appetite, these are the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yossi says, One may continue to eat until it gets dark.\" [So why deal with eves of Pesachs in our Mishna?] Rav Huna said, \"This [Mishna] is only needed for Rabbi Yossi, who said, One may continue to eat until it gets dark. When do these words apply? To the eves of the Sabbaths and Festivals, but to the eve of Pesach, because there is the obligation of Matza, he would agree [that one may not eat on the eve of Pesach].\" Rav Pappa said, \"Even if you'll say [this Mishna is also needed within] Rabbi Yehuda, there [where he forbade eating] for eves of Sabbaths and Festivals, that was a prohibition from Mincha and on, but close to Mincha was permitted. But on the eve of Pesach, even close to Mincha would be forbidden.\" And would close to Mincha on the eve of the Sabbath be permitted [for eating]? But it is taught [in a Baraita], \"One may not eat on the eve of Sabbath and Festivals from 9 hours and on, in order that one may enter the Sabbath with an appetite, these are the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yossi says, One may continue to eat unto it gets dark.\" [Thus, close to Mincha is also forbidden according to Rabbi Yehuda!] Mar Zutra said, \"Who says that this [text] is a correct one?"

            "Maybe it's mistaken!\" Mareimar, and some say it was Rav Yeimar, said, \"I visited the lecture of Rav Pinchas the son of Rav Ami, and a reciter got up and recited it [that way] in front of him and [Rav Pinchas] accepted it!\" If so, then this is a difficulty! Rather, it's clear [the answer is] according to Rav Huna. Is this really well for Rav Huna? But Rabbi Yirmiya said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, and some say it was Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Yossi the son of Rabbi Chanina, \"The law is like Rabbi Yehuda on the eve of Pesach, and like Rabbi Yossi on the eve of the Sabbath.\" \"The law is like Rabbi Yehuda...\" implies that Rabbi Yossi is arguing on both [the eve of Pesach and the Sabbath]! No, \"the law is...\" implies they argue about stopping [the meal]. As it is taught [in a baraita], \"We stop [eating] for the Sabbaths, these are the words of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yossi said, We do not stop [eating]. An occurrence happened that Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yossi were eating in Acre, and the day became holy [the Sabbath having started]. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said to Rabbi Yossi, \"Do you want to stop and be concerned for the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda our colleague?\" [Rabbi Yossi] said to him, \"Each and every day you have favored my opinions over Rabbi Yehuda's, and now you are favoring Rabbi Yehuda's over mine? 'Even to take the queen while I'm in the house?' [Esther 7:8]\". He said to him, \"If so, we should not stop, lest the students see and establish it that way forever.\" They say they did not budge until they established the law like Rabbi Yossi.", 
            "Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel, \"The law is not like Rabbi Yehuda, nor like Rabbi Yossi, but rather one spreads a cover and makes kiddush [therefore not stopping completely, but not continuing either].\" Is that so? But Rav Tachlifa bar Avdimi said in the name of Shmuel, \"Just like one should stop [the meal] for kiddush,"
        ], 
        [
            "so too we stop [the meal] for havdalah.\" What is \"we stop\"? Is it not [referring to] removal of the table [like that of Rabbi Yehuda]? No, [it refers only to] covering. Rabbah bar Rav Huna visited the exilarch. They brought a tray before him, and he spread a covering over and made kiddush. It was also taught like this [in a baraita], \"We should not bring in the table unless one has made kiddush. If they had brought it in, spread a cover and make kiddush.\" One teaching: They agree that one may not begin [a meal on an eve]. Another teaching: They agree that one may begin [a meal on an eve]. This is well according to the one who taught \"They agree one may not begin,\" for it can apply to the eve of Pesach. But the one who taught \"They agree that one may begin,\" when is that? If you'll say the eve of the Sabbath, they surely argue! That is not a difficulty, here [where they agree] is before the 9th hour, there [where they argue whether one may begin] is after the 9th hour. Those people that have kiddush made for them in the synagogue: Rav said, \"They have not completed their duty for wine, but for kiddush, they have completed their duty.\" Shmuel said,"
