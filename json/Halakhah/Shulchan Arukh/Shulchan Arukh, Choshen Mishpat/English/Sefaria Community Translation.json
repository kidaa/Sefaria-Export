            "In these time judges judge the laws of  confessions to a loan, loans, kesuba of a woman, inheritance, gifts, and cases which damage anothers money(assets, or income) because these cases are common always. Case which are not common even though there is a loss of money for example a animal that wounds another animal, or cases which are common but don't have a loss of money  such as paying double (when fined for stealing an item) and such is the case with all fines that the sages instituted like a fine for when someone blows in into his friends ear and scares him, or hits his friend, and so to in any case where they required one to pay more then the principal amount of damage or where you would be required half the damage we don't judge them. they may only be judged by specialist who have smicha in Israel. Except in the case where you pay half the damage for damage caused by pebbles (such as when an animal walks and it kicks up pebbles and they cause damage) because this is a loss of money, and not a fine (a fine is extra punishment to the value of a principle damage) "

(Tur in the name of his father, the Rosh, in the beginning of Sanhedrin) but in any case, they are able to accept the [possibility of] error, and send them before a teacher.) (Maharam Paduah, Section 43) And they may judge a man against his will if the defendant refuses to go down to judgement or if he does not want to be judged with the prosecutor in his town. But, if he wants to be judged with him in his town, but does not want to be judged by the three judges that the prosecutor chose, then he [the defendant] chooses one judge, and he [the prosecutor] chooses one judge. Note: Like what is taught later on in Section 13. And it seems to me that this is specifically with judges that were not set, but if there are judges that were set in the city, he may not say, \"I will not be judged before them, rather with this [judge], I choose,\" and this is the practice in our town. And see later Section 22 end of paragraph 1."

            "<i><b>Rema</b>: Regarding those guilty of the death penalty in our days, we have no power to give them lashes, exile them, kill them, or beat them. Instead we censure them and distance them from the community (<b>Tur 68</b> from Natronai Gaon). Thus far regarding [strictly Torah] law. However, if the beit din sees a necessity for a preventative measure, it has the authority to institue whatever punishment they see fit (ibid., from the Responsa of the Natronai Gaon), as explained above in Siman 2. This regards those instances involving capital punishment which necessitates a beit din. Cases in which the death penalty can be implemented even without a beit din, are still judged in our days, as will be explained (ibid.).</i> One who pursuses his fellow in order to kill him, and was warned, and continued in his pursuit: Even if the pursuer was a minor, every Jew is commanded to save the pursed, even at the cost of one maiming one of the pursuer's limbs. If it is impossible to save the pursued without killing the pursuer outright, then the pursuer should indeed be killed, even though he has not yet performed the act. <i><b>Rema</b>: (<b>Tur 67</b>) One who \"tunnels [into a house] in order steal\" has this rule of pursuer applied to him, however if it is understood that his only intent is monetary gain, and that he would not kill the owner in a confrontation, then it is forbidden to kill him. See further in the Tur in this paragraph regarding one who endangers the public, such as a Jew who engages in forgery in a land where the authorities take a strict approach to such action, such a person constitutes a \"pursuer\" and it is permitted to turn him over to the authorities (<b>Nimukei Maharam MiRizburg</b>), as explained above in 388:12.</i>"
