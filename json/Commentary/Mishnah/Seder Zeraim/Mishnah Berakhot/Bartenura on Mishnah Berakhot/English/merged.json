                "Mishna: \"From the time that the Priests enter to eat their Terumah(heave offering).\" -----(Bartenura): Priests that have become ritually impure and have immersed (in a ritual bath), are not able to eat [with(lit.)] terumah until \"the sun has set\", which (in actuality) denotes the coming out of the stars. And note, it was not taught from the time of the coming out of the stars, which we have been informed of incidentally, that if the priests became ritually impure with a form of impurity in which their purification requires a sacrifice, for example a Zav(emission) or Metzorah(skin affliction), the atonement(i.e. sacrifice) does not prevent them from eating terumah, as it is written: \"and the setting sun, he is pure (Leviticus 22:7)\", and after he will eat from the sanctified food; the setting of the sun prevents eating of terumah. And atonement(i.e. sacrifice) does not prevent from eating of terumah etc.", 
                "Mishna: \"Until the end of the first watch\" ----- (Bartenura): The first third of the night, that the night is divided into 3 watches. And from here and forward it is not referred to as the time of reciting the Shema of \"with laying down\" (i.e. Shema of nighttime), and it is not called with your \"laying down.\" And before (the time of) the coming out of the stars is also daytime, and not the time of \"laying down.\" And those that rush forward (mitzvot) and recite the Shema of nighttime while it is still day, they rely on that which was state by Rabbi Judah later in the chapter of Tefillat HaShachar(Morning Prayer), that the Afternoon Prayer is until Plag HaMincha(division of afternoon). That is, an hour and a fourth before nighttime. Thus it has been established \"that one that performs in accordance of Rabbi Judah has indeed performed\", and immediately at the completion of the time for the afternoon prayer, the time of the recitation of the Shema of nighttime begins.", 
                "Mishna: \"Until the coming up of the dawn\" ----(Bartenura): That the entire night is referred to as the \"time of laying down.\" The law is in accordance with Rabban Gamliel, for also the Wise Men are in agreement to him, and they do not state \"until midnight\" but only in order to distance the man from sin. Nevertheless, ideally when the time (season lit.) of the recitation of the Shema at nightime of the instruction, namely from the coming out of the stars, is reached, it is forbidden to conduct a meal, and how much more so to sleep, until one has recited the Shema and prayed."
