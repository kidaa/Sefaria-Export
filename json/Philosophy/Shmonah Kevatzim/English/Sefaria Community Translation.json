                "The wild man thought, that all that he can chew and swallow is nutritious, until experience taught him to distinguish between the harmful and helpful weeds and roots, the nutritious ones and the non-nutritious ones, the tasteful ones and the non-tasteful ones. And all that is happening in the material values is happening in the spiritual ones, except that this study is late to come. And the spiritual savage thinks, that all that is read and written will feed his soul, until he come to distinguish between holy and profane, between the things that give eternal life, and the things that disrupt the course of the true life.
