Kitzur Shulkhan Aruch Yalkut Yosef

Chelek 1



Siman 1

We learned in Masechet Avot (Pirkei Avot 5:20) "Be bold like a leopard, light like an eagle, fleeting like a deer, and mightly like a lion to do the wish of your Father in Heaven." And they learned from here four rules in serving Hashem "be bold like a leopard" when someone does a Miswa they shouldn't be embarrassed from people who mock him. "Light like an eagel" to close his eyes from seeing evil because the eyes are the instigators of the sin. "Fleeting like a deer" the feet should run to good deeds. "Mightly like a lion" this is a overpowering over the evil inclination. Therefor one should fight like a lion to stand in the morning to serve Hashem, like you awaken the day. No matter what one shouldn't be late on "Zeman Tefila" or "Zeman Keriat Shema". [The main fighting should be in the heart to fight against the evil inclination. Like someone fighting against his enemy to knock him down. This is how one should fight is evil inclination]. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 57).
One should be careful to be modest when he dresses or undresses, and one shouldn't say "Behold I am in hidden rooms 'who can see me?' because Hashem's presence fills the entire universe. A person who usually dresses modest should be careful not to reveal [skin] out of respect for Hashem. When one arises he should be very swift to dress himself. A child who understands things should be taught from a young age to dress himself modestly. (Yalkut Yosef, Hashkamat HaBoker pg. 207).
