", 
            "And there will be from the brook for you to drink, and I commanded the ravens to sustain you there.And he went and did according to the word of the Lord, and he went and dwelled by the brook of Crit, on the banks of the Jordan.  And the ravens were bringing to him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening.  And from the brook he drank.", 
            "And so it happened that it was the end of the year, and the brook had dried up, for there was not any rain in the land.   "
