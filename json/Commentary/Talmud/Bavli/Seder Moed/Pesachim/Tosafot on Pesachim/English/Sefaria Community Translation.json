                "<b>They were in that same miracle:</b> Rashba\"m explained that they [the Jews] were redeemed through them [the women]. And similarly, in the Megilla, through Esther, and in Chanuka, through Judith. And it is difficult, since \"even\" implies that they aren't the main thing. And also, the version in the Jerusalem Talmud is \"even they were in that same uncertainty,\" implying in that danger of \"to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish\" (Esther 3:13). And this that we say that they [women] are exempt from [the commandment of] sukka, even though that even they were in that same miracle, is [based on] \"that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths\" (Leviticus 23:43), there, is regarding a positive Torah commandment. However, regarding the four cups, which is rabbinic, they established it also for women, since they were in that same miracle."
