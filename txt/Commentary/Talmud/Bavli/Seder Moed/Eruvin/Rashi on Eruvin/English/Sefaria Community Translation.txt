Line 31


They studied their own rulings and those of Beit Shammai - When Beit Shammai would bring proof to their rulings from the Torah and Beit Hillel would bring proof from another verse, and Beit Hillel would expound the verse of Beit Shammai to show its relevance, and it was not light in their eyes, as they studied in Tractate Berakhot (Berakhot 10b), "Beit Shammai say, In the morning, every man should lean and read [Kiryat Shema'] and in the morning he should stand as it says, (Devarim 6:7) 'When you lie down and when you arise'; and Beit Hillel say, Every man should read as he is, as it says, (Ibid.) 'When you are on the way'. If so, what does it say, 'When you lie down and when you arise'? - [Recite] at the time that people normally lie down and at the time that people normally arise [i.e., in the evening and in the morning]."

Line 32

They mention the actions of Beth Shammai before theirs - As they first said in the story that the "elders of Beth Shammai went" and subsequently, the "elders of Beth Hillel".
