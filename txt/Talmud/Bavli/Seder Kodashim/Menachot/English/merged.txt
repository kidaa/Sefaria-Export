Rabbi Yehudah said, "Rav said, 
"When Moshe ascended to the heavens, he found the Holy One, Blessed be He, sitting and attaching crowns to the letters. He said before Him,
"Master of the Universe! Who is staying your hand?"
He said to him,
"There is one man man who will exist after many generations, and Akiva the son of Yosef is his name, who will in the future expound on every crown and crown piles and piles of laws."
He said before Him,
"Master of the Universe! Show him to me."
He said to him, 
"Turn backwards."
He went and sat at the end of eight rows [of students in Rabbi Akiva's Beit Midrash], and he did not know what they were talking [about]. He got upset.
As soon as he got to one [other] thing, his students said to him,
"Our teacher, from where do you learn this?"
He said to them,
"It is a law [that was taught] to Moshe at Sinai."
He calmed down.
He returned and came before the Holy One, Blessed be He, and said before Him,
"Master of the Universe! You have a man like this, and You are giving the Torah through me?"
He said to Him, 
"Be silent. This is what I have decided."
He said before Him,
"Master of the Universe! You have shown me his Torah; show me his reward." He said to him,
"Turn backwards." He turned backwards, and saw that they were tearing his skin with iron combs. He said before Him,
"Master of the Universe! Such Torah, and such reward!"
He said to him,
"Be silent. This is what I have decided."

Rabbi Eliezer son of Yaacov says:  ..
Everyone who has tefillin on his head and tefillin on his arm and tsitsit on his clothes and a mezuzah at his door, it is all subject to a presumption that he will not sin, as it is said, 
“and the three-fold cord will not easily be broken” (Eccles. 4:12).  And it says, ...
“The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them” (Psalm 34:8).
It was taught in a baraita, Rabbi Meir used to say, ...
why is tekhelet singled out from all the colors?  ...
Because tekhelet is similar to the sea, and the sea is similar to the firmament, and the firmament is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is said, ...
“and there was under His feet the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness,” and it is written, 
"a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone.”


... 
It was taught in a Baraita: R. Meir said:
a person must make 100 blessings each day, as it is written...
(Deuteronomy 10:12) "And now Israel, what does the Lord your God ask of you..."
