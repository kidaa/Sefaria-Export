                "<b>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth:</b> The reason that the Torah started with the letter 'bet' is that King Shlomo, in all of the book of Kohelet, compares the Torah to the Sun, which only moves in three directions like the shape of the 'bet,' that is only open on its north side [according to ancient maps that would place north on the left of the page and east on top]; and because it was given through Moshe, whose face is like the sun; and maybe the reason is that the evil inclination that opposes the Torah comes from the North and it 'breaks the fence' of the Torah, as it is stated (Joel 2:20), \"And the northern one will I distance from you.\" And also because gold, which comes form the North, opposes the Torah; and they generally flee from one another, as it is stated (Psalms 119:71), \"It is good that I have become poor, so that I can learn your statute;\" And this is not the place to speak more about this. And it is possible to also explain it, in the way that it is stated (Proverbs 9:1), \"Wise women have built their house;\" hence, the wisdom of the Torah began with 'bet' [which sounds like <i>bayit</i>, the Hebrew word for house], since it is the mistress of the larger 'house.'", 
                "<b>In the beginning, created God...:</b> It would have been fitting to begin the Torah with the name of God; so much so that the Sages of blessed memory needed to change [the word order in their Greek translation] for King Ptolemy and write, \"God created the beginning.\" And about this, the commentators have given a reason that is praiseworthy: Since the existence of God, may He be praised, is impossible to fathom except though His attributes, His acts and the work of His hands, that He created; they are the ones that testify, speak and give faithful testimony about His blessed existence; therefore [the Torah] mentioned first, \"In the beginning, created\" and afterward is God made known. But there is a difficulty about this, since it should have been written, \"Created God the beginning,\" since it is logical that  anything that the name of God could precede, it should precede; since behold [the knowledge of] the existence of God is not dependent upon the knowledge of the earlier things in the creation, about which the word <i>bereshit</i> [in the beginning] relates to, according to most commentators.", 
                "And also [difficult] is that the writer of the <i>Akeida</i> [commentary - R. Yitschak Arama] based this explanation on the midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 1:12), \"'And Your humility enlarges me' (Psalms 18:36); A king of flesh and blood mentions his name first and afterwards his acts, but the Holy One, blessed be He, mentioned His name after He mentioned His acts;\" and what His humility is in this needs to be understood; and that which it says \"made me great,\" in what way did He enlarge us and make us great? And what appears most likely to me, is to say that Rashi wanted to fix all of this when he said that \"this text says nothing if not 'interpret me' - [the term <i>reshit</i>, literally, the start or head of is used here] because of the Torah and Israel which are [both] called <i>reshit</i>;\" which means to say that it is impossible to know about God's existence, may He be blessed, except through the Torah and Israel. That's why they are called <i>reshit</i>, since they are both an introduction through which one comes to the knowledge of God's existence, may He be blessed [and so precede the name of God in the first sentence of the Torah.] Since the Torah publicizes faith in His creation and Divinity, may He be blessed. And Israel also knew to publicize the existence of God, may He be blessed, from the angle of the transmission that they received, one person from another, back to Adam who saw the world destroyed and built, and is a faithful witness to the creation of the world, which is a sign [indication] of its Creator; and this transmission was spread by the offspring of Avraham, Yitschak and Yisrael.", 
                "And there is also a third way [to know about the existence of God], but not every one is capable of it, and that is to come to know about the existence of God, may He be blessed, through investigation and knowledge of all that is to be found in all of the three worlds and this is their order: At first, the researcher must understand the essence of things in the lowest world, since it is the easiest research [that exists]. And after knowing their essence, he should [seek to] also understand the essence of the creatures of the middle world. And from there, he should go up, [as] with a ladder going up the different levels, to know the essence of the highest world. And from there, he should go up to know and fathom that there is God who is found to ride upon all of them [and] who arranged them in this fashion, like the vision that Ya'akov saw (Genesis 28:12); in the four rungs of the ladder which was \"positioned on the ground\" - which [represents] comprehension of the lower world - \"and its tip reached the skies\" - this [represents] the middle world - \"and the angels were going up and down on it;\" - this [represents] the top world. \"And behold the Lord stood upon it,\" (Genesis 28:13) since then [Ya'akov] grasped completely the existence of God, may He be blessed.", 
                "However, not many will have the wisdom needed for this approach of investigation, to come to the secret of God, as a result of man's passage through this dimmed valley of the material world; hence it is enough for man to grasp His existence, may He be blessed, from the angle of the transmission as mentioned and from the angle of the Torah as mentioned. And about this the Sages, of blessed memory, have said (Chullin 91b) that the lower ones mention His name, may He be blessed, after two words, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:4), \"Hear Yisrael, the Lord,\" but the upper ones don't mention the Name until after three words, as it is stated (Isaiah 6:3), \"Holy, holy, holy [is] the Lord.\" Because the intellectual power of the upper ones is pure and clean and it is easy for them to handle the essence of the investigation of these three worlds; therefore they are not allowed to mention the Name except after three holinesses, which means that they first cognate the essence of all those that exist below and understand the place of each and, through this, sanctify Him, may He be blessed, below. And from there they go up to understand the essence of all those that exist in the middle world and they sanctify Him, may He be blessed, to reign also upon them. And from there they go up to also understand their own essence, and from there they go up to grasp His name, may He be blessed; hence they do not mention the Name until they sanctify Him first in all three worlds. But the lower ones' intellects are not so pure, and not every person is able to handle this investigation since it is great; hence it is enough for them to come to recognize the existence of God, may He be blessed after the two words, \"Hear Israel;\" since \"Hear\" is to listen to the words of this Torah which publicize His divinity, may He be blessed; \"Israel\" is the transmission that spread in Israel from Adam to Abraham, who announced and publicized His divinity, may He be blessed, as Rashi explained on the verse (Genesis 24:7), \"Lord God of the heavens that took me from the house of my father;\" and from [Avraham], His divinity, may He be blessed, was publicized in all of the offspring of Israel and Yehuda, as it is stated (Psalms 76:2), \"God is known in Yehuda, in Israel His name is great.\" Thus it is stated, \"In the beginning, created\" and afterwards, \"God,\" to hint to the three [ways of knowing God's existence]: since <i>reshit</i> [beginning of] indicates Israel and the Torah, that are [both] called <i>reshit</i>; and through the creation [hence the word \"created\"], God was made known [directly through the mode of investigation]. And this is the way of modesty, by which He - in a hint - had the name of Israel precede His name, may He be blessed, [since \"<i>reshit</i>\" precedes \"created\"] and that is truthfully glorious splendor and greatness [that He gave] to Israel; hence it is stated \"And Your humility enlarges me.\" And some say that this humility is what He was involved with at first, for the needs of His world, and [only] afterwards did He publicize His name, may He be blessed.", 
                "<b>Rabbi Yitschak said, \"It was not necessary to begin the Torah, etc. but rather so that the nations should not say, 'you are thieves, etc.'\" (Rashi on Genesis 1:1):</b> And it is difficult; and what about it, if they will say, \"you are thieves,\" and because of this, the  order of the Torah should be changed? The answer to this is that  this matter brings heresy to the world, since they will say, \"there is no law and no Judge\" [in the world] and 'whoever is strongest prevails;' since if the world had a Ruler, who sets up its matters - it comings and goings - why did He not protest against you when you took by force - by way of theft - the lands of the seven [Canaanite] nations? Since it is for this reason that the judgment of the generation of the flood was not sealed except on account of theft, as it is stated (Proverbs 28:24), \"One who steals from his father and mother and says 'it is not a transgression' is the companion of a destructive person;\" since the reason this sin is greater than others is not because of the sin itself, but rather because of the evil that comes out of it; as the sinner who steals does not place guilt upon himself and says, \"there is no transgression, since there is no God that judges in the world;\" and therefore he is the companion of a destructive person, which means to say, [he is a companion] of the generation of the flood, as it is stated about them (Genesis 6:12), \"since all flesh <i>destroyed</i> its way,\" since they also denied a principle of faith and said (Job 21:15), \"What is the Omnipotent, that we should serve Him, etc.\" And this is what [brought] them to practice extortion and theft in the world. And because the prevention of theft is fundamental to all of faith, therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, made it come early and warned about it in the first commandment of (Exodus 12:2), \"This month will be for you;\" as over there, it is stated (Exodus 12:21), \"And bring close and acquire <i>for yourselves</i> sheep,\" [meaning] from yours, and [not from] stolen ones; so explained the Ba'al HaTurim. And so too, Yitschak, when he commanded two kid goats to be brought to him, to make from them a Pesach sacrifice, he said (Genesis 27:3), \"And hunt <i>for me</i> venison;\" Rashi explained, from what is unowned and not from what is stolen, but since Esav's heart was not like that, it appeared to him that he could  rather \"hunt venison <i>to bring</i>,\" even form what is stolen; hence the Holy One, blessed be He, caused that he should not bring it, but rather that Ya'akov [should do so], as he was careful about theft. So too, the ox that Adam sacrificed, the Sages, of blessed memory, say that it had one horn on its forehead; to show that Adam [too] was one 'horn' in the world - meaning to say that he was by himself in the world - and did not steal from any creature; therefore, his sacrifice was accepted. And all this is in order to push away theft and robbery which brings heresy and apostasy.", 
                "And that which Rav Yitschak said, \"It was not necessary to begin, etc,\" the explanation [of this] is not that the whole story from \"In the beginning\" to \"This month shall be for you\" should not have been written in the Torah at all; as behold there is a great need for the story of the creation of the world, since it publicizes the existence of God, may He be blessed; and the story of the generation of the flood publicizes His providence, may He be blessed, for reward and punishment. Besides that, there are  several commandments written in [this early section of the Torah: the prohibition of eating] the limb of a living animal to Noach, and circumcision to Avraham, and [the prohibition of eating] the sciatic nerve through Ya'akov. Rather, he means to say that since the essence of the Torah is that it was given for its commandments, if so, the Torah should have started with the first commandment [to the Jewish people]; and [as for] this story from \"In the beginning\" to \"This month shall be for you,\" it would be enough for it to placed at the end of the Torah. About this, he comes to answer and say, if it was written like that, it would have been 'a law refutable from its beginning,' and it would have strengthened the hand of the transgressors to rebel against the Torah. And when they would read \"This month shall be for you,\" all the more so would they rebel [even] more, and they will say, \"Moshe certainly invented this commandment, since how can God command about theft, in saying \"And bring close and acquire <i>for yourselves</i> sheep,\" [meaning] specifically from yours; since, behold, you are thieves, since you took the lands of the seven nations and God did not protest against you. Since maybe [such a reader] would not read the Torah, from beginning to end [and read about the creation, so as to understand that the Jews did not steal the land that they settled]. Therefore, it was necessary to have the story of the creation of the world precede [the first commandment of establishing the new month], to show that it is not through theft that they took [the land], but rather through justice and right. This is what the verse states (Psalms 111:6-7), \"The power of His deeds did He tell His people, to give them the inheritance of nations. The work of His hands are true and right, faithful are all of His precepts;\" since the crux of this telling that \"He told the power of His deeds to His people,\" the whole thing was in order to show that the work of His hands are true and right; that the Torah, and the tablets that are the work of God, and the righteous ones that were created with [God's] two hands; that all [of this] was in truth and right, which prevents theft. \"And faithful are all of His precepts;\" [meaning] the precepts that God decreed upon the lands of the seven nations; since it was His will, may He be blessed, to give it to [the seven Canaanite nations] and it was  His will, may He be blessed, to take it from them and God, the King, decreed to appoint new appointees upon it.\" ", 
                "And according to its simple understanding, it was necessary to begin the Torah from \"In the beginning,\" to publicize belief in creation [<i>ex nihilo</i>], since it is the foundation of the entire Torah; since were we to assume that the world was pre-existent, there would be no room to accept a Torah that is predicated upon the foundation of free choice; therefore, it is required to place the foundation [meaning, the creation story] first.

                "<b>And the earth was chaos and void:</b> 'What was, was' and what is the need of this knowledge? And it appears that we can say that, since - from the six days of creation and onwards - the Holy One, blessed be He, does not change anything from how it was [then;] and the Holy One, blessed be He, foresaw that because of the actions of the wicked, the world would go back to [being] chaos and void - as in the generation of the flood; and so [too] with the destruction of the Temple, it is written (Jeremiah 4:23), \"I saw the world, and behold, it was chaos.\" And [so] the verse [here in Genesis 1:2] informs us that if at any future time it should happen that, through the actions of the wicked, the world will go back to being chaos, it should not be considered a change in the creation; but rather the world will go back to how it was, since it is its nature to be chaos and void and darkness. And through the actions of the righteous, the Holy One, blessed be He, overturned its nature and created light for the righteous; and through the corruption of the actions of the wicked, the world will go back to how it was; and it will not be considered a change in the creation, but rather the world will go back to how it was. And this is not called a change in creation, since this is a condition that the Holy One, blessed be He, made with all of the work of creation. And for this reason He decreased the light, and hid [the additional light that was taken away] for the righteous; since He, may He be blessed, is not a man that He should change His mind, but rather if the 'wicked will be silenced with darkness' because of the corruption of their deeds, it will not be considered a change in the creation. And this is the opinion of the midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 2:5): \"'And the earth was chaos' - these are the actions of the wicked; 'And the Lord said \"Let there be light,\"' - these are the actions of the righteous, etc.\" What did the writer of this midrash see to take the verses out from their simple meaning? But according to what we have explained, the words of the midrash are understood, since the simple meaning stays in its place and the <i>drash</i> is an interpretation also of its simple meaning. And that with which it concludes there, \"And I do not yet know which one He desires, if it is the actions of the wicked, etc.,\" you will find explained in my short essay, entitled The Way of Life, in the homiletic discourse on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, see there."

                "<b>And the Lord said, \"let there be light:\"</b> The word, <i>ohr</i> [light], is written five times in this section; and on the fourth day the word, <i>meohr</i> [luminaries] is written five times, with the addition of [the letter] <i>mem</i> [to the word <i>ohr</i>], and there is in this an amazing intention. And that is that since we have found that the Sages, of blessed memory, said (Chagigah 12a), \"The light that was created on the first day was hidden\" and there is [also] an opinion that says, \"these are the very luminaries that were created on the first day and were not 'hung' until the fourth day;\" and these two midrashic statements appear to contradict one another. But the truth is not thus, since everyone admits that the light of the first day was a great light and was [then] hidden and that those luminaries that were 'hung' on the fourth day are not the actual light [of the first day], but rather they received their light from a spark of the upper light that was created on the first day; therefore, the word, <i>ohr</i>, is mentioned [on the first day], since it was the actual light; but with luminaries on the fourth day, each one is mentioned as  <i>meohr</i>, with the addition of [the letter] <i>mem</i>, to show that they received their light from another light - greater than them - which is what is shown by the [letter] <i>mem</i> [which, when in front of a word, is a prefix that means, 'from']. And according to this, the midrashic statements do not contradict one another; since the first light was hidden - according to everyone - for the righteous, and the luminaries of the fourth day received a spark of the first light; and if so, certainly, 'they are the very luminaries,' since a part [i.e., the luminaries] is included in the whole [i.e., the light created on the first day]. And with this is also resolved [why] they were created [only to be] hidden; and this is a precious explanation."

And it appears, that he is coming to advise man, [about] that which we see; that is in his nature to always long for his actions to extend without end and without limit and that everything should be permissible in his eyes; 'everything  that he wants, he does;' and if a man relies on his nature, then there will be no boundary and end to the chariot of the lusting of his desire; and  anarchy [would seem] good for him, such that there should be no limiting and stop to any action; up until God rebuked us through this Torah, which gives us a boundary and measure to all [our] actions; [to inform us] how far they can extend, according to the divine Will, and up until where is it permitted for [man] to send out the rein of his desire. ", 
                "And it is a wonder about man, how is it that he did not find it in his intellect to set up a limit and measure for all of his actions - as with the rational commandments and what is similar to them - without divine intervention, since the intellect [should] compel [the rational commandments]. About this [the Torah] said, don't wonder about this desire [that gets in the way of his intellect,] since man acquired his nature from those that gave birth to him. Given that all men are formed from the skies, the land and the sea; since the soul is from the sky and the body is from the earth, which is made like clay, with water, as was explained by Rashi on the verse (Genesis 6:2), \"And mist went up from the earth.\" And from the three of them a man is made complete, since the word, man [<i>eesh</i>] is [made up of] the first letters of earth [<i>erets</i>], sea [<i>yam</i>] and air [<i>shamayim</i>]. And usually, one finds the nature of the parents in the offspring; and so too, man received the nature of his 'parents,' sky, land and sea; since all of them were expanding and continuing without end, until God rebuked them - as that which it stated, \"it was continually expanding,\" is also speaking about the earth, since this is the reason it mentions <i>two</i> bundles. And from then on, this has become the perpetual nature of all who are created from them, since 'like them will be their makers' - that [man] will have the will to expand in all of his actions without end.", 
                "And nonetheless, the author of this statement comes to reprove man, to tell [him] that if he acquired their nature that he should have a desire to expand, as mentioned, behold, he should, at least, also acquire from them the good; to stop with the rebuke of God, may He be blessed, just like they stopped at the rebuke of God - in the manner of not going past it even a hair's breadth, so [too] man should stop at the rebuke of God, in the measure and amount in which God limited all actions through this Torah. And this is the intention of the statement in the Yalkut, Parshat Ha'azinu (32:942), \"Stare at the sky and earth and at the sea, etc... lest they changed their traits, etc.\" And this reason was stated by the Sages, of blessed memory,  concerning the commandment of fringes (Sotah 17a), \"Aquamarine is similar to the sea and the sea is similar to to the sky, etc.,\" since through the aquamarine, he will remember the sea and the sky, and learn from them to stop at the rebuke of God, not to change the measure [of what God forbids him], as will be explained, with God's help, in Parshat Shelach (Bemidbar 15:38). And that which it doesn't state, \"Let there be a firmament and there was a firmament,\" in the [same] way that it states, \"And there was light,\" is because 'a bad statement is not quickly done;' hence the firmament which teaches division was not done immediately; but the light, which was good for all, was done quickly, and so it immediately states, \"And there was light.\""

Since any [<i>rakiya</i>] is a covering that separates between two things.

And here, it is asked, why wasn't it cursed immediately. And it appears that this is not a question at all, given that the main curse was that the earth should give forth mosquitos and fleas, as Rashi explained on the verse (Genesis 3:17), \"Cursed is the ground on your account.\" But all of these things are destructive to man, and [hence] so long as man didn't sin, the ground was not cursed to bring up cursed things; since even if the earth sinned, nonetheless what was man's sin, that fleas and mosquitos should run after him; but once man also sinned, both of them were fitting for this curse. And later, in Parshat Achrei Mot, on the verse (Vayikra 18:25), \"And the land shall be defiled and I will remember its iniquity upon it,\" it will be explained, with God's help, that the will of the Power, may He be blessed, was to give a clear and fine consistency to his creations, but [instead] He gave them a coarse and thick consistency. And had He given them a clear and fine consistency, the taste of the tree would have been as the taste of the fruit; and also man would not have a tendency for the most physical and he would not have come to sin. Nonetheless, from the angle that [the earth] sinned and gave a coarse consistency, it also caused the tree to make fruit and not [be a] fruit-tree; and this thing also caused man to sin, since this is the reason that man inclined to physicality and he fell to the sin. Therefore, with all of man's sins, the earth is punished and 'its iniquity is remembered upon it,' as will be explained later on, with God's help.", 
                "And it appears that another correct reason can be given in this matter: since the snake saw that the earth changed the will of its Creator and, nonetheless, did not get punished; hence the snake found room to say to the woman, \"you will not surely die,\" even if she go against the will of her Creator, in the [same] way as the earth did not get punished for that which it did not bring out trees, the taste of which was like the taste of the fruit. And so the snake said, [you will not die] even if God said, \"don't eat from every <i>tree</i> of the garden;\" that is to say, is the tree fitting to be eaten, that He should command you not to eat even from the tree [itself]? And the woman said, \"from the <i>fruit</i> of the garden may we eat;\" [meaning] I agree with your words, that only the fruit of the trees in the garden are fitting to eat and not the tree, hence there was no reason for Him to command us except on the fruit of the tree that is in the garden, and not on the tree [itself]. And the snake said, you will not die, since behold, don't you agree with this: the earth changed [what was commanded of it] and nonetheless was not punished; so too you will not die, you too [just like the earth]."

                "<b>\"Let there be luminaries in the firmament of the heavens:\"</b> Luminaries (<i>meorot</i>) is written in [its] incomplete spelling [meaning that it lacks the letter <i>vav</i>]. Rashi explains that [hence] this [can be read also] as the word, curses (<i>ma'arot</i>), etc. I say that the following  is the reason a word that indicates curse is mentioned specifically with the luminaries: since the luminaries are the cause of time and all things that come under time involve pain. As the Rabbis, of blessed memory, said (Megillah 10b), \"Every place where it is stated, 'and it was' is nothing but a place of pain\" and [the Talmud] concludes that it is only in a place where it is stated \"and it was in the days of\" that it is an expression of pain; and the reason for this matter is because any thing that is dependent on days - meaning, on time - involves pain, but all of the higher existences that are above time, and time does not rule over them, they do not involve any pain. Therefore, it is stated, \"Let there be luminaries,\" in [its] incomplete spelling, because all things that are under the sun involve curses and pain, since time wears everything out. And that which variants of the word, luminary (<i>me'ohr</i>), appear in this section five time and, so [too] in the first section, five variants of the word, light (<i>ohr</i>), agrees with the words of the midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 2:5), which says, \"'And the Lord said, \"let there be light,\"' these are the actions of the righteous, etc.,\" and wants to explain the five times [that] light [is mentioned] corresponds to the five books of the Torah, [the study and practice of] which are the actions of the righteous."

                "<b>\"Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly:\"</b> And later it is stated that the birds were created from the dirt. And the rabbis of blessed memory said (Chullin 27b), by way of compromise, that they were created from the swamp. It comes out that the birds were the intermediate of the animals - that were created from the land - and the fish - that were created from the sea. They taught through this, that these three types were not created except for man, [meaning] that they should be slaves to him. A hint to this is that [the word] 'slave' [<i>eved</i>] is [made up  of] the first letters of bird [<i>off</i>], animal [<i>behama</i>] and fish [<i>dagim</i>]. [This is] since all [of them] did God give to [man] as slaves, and [so] man has a hand in the sea and on the land, and upon both [sea and land] of together; so that man not find anything that is not given into his dominion. ", 
                "And by way of [seeking the Torah's] hint [here], we have found that [different] groups of people relate to these three types; that the evil ones that incline towards the most earthly [matters] are compared 'to animals are they similar,' since also [the animals] come from the ground; and the righteous are compared to water, as their consistency is lighter than the consistency of the land, and are compared to fish, whose main life is from the water; and those in between are compared to the birds who fly between the sky and the earth, which is the intermediate between the spiritual and the physical, and its substance is form the water and the dirt, as was stated. And it appears that for this reason, a double blessing was stated about the fish - \"be fruitful and multiply\" - in the same way as what is mentioned for the human race. And with the birds, only one blessing is stated, \"and the birds should multiply in the earth.\" But with the animals, no blessing is stated at all. And all of this is understood from itself, and [also] agrees with the words of the Rabbis, of blessed memory (Midrash Aggadah Bereshit 1), \"No blessing was stated for the domesticated and wild animals because of the snake, etc.;\" since the evil impulse - whose strength comes from the primordial snake - crouches there; among the group of evildoers, that are compared to domesticated and wild animals of the earth; and would it only be that they be reduced and not increase. And [it] will be explained more in Parshat Beha'alotekha that (Numbers 11:3), \"the mixed multitude that was among them\" - which were those in between - asked for meat and fish, which was not their type; and [instead] the meat of fowl was given to them, [and so] 'the type found its type.'"

                "And that which is written (Genesis 9:6), \"Since in the image of God did He create man\" [and not also in the image of the earth,] is to tell of the wonder that through [the Divine image], man is separated from all other animals. And many agreed with this explanation, and there [also] came many other explanations regarding the saying of \"Let <i>us</i> make\" and regarding the image and the likeness. And it is correct to say that it is [also] for this reason that [the Torah] stated the words, \"Let us make;\" to show His dominion, may He be blessed, specifically when He made man, to teach that the essence of His kingship is seen in His creatures, [meaning] from man who He formed for His glory. And regarding the image and the likeness, even though it is stated (Isaiah 40:18), \"What image will you compare Him to,\" and it is written (Isaiah 40:25), \"To who will you liken Me, that I should be equal,\" nonetheless we have found that the Holy One, blessed be He, appears to His prophets in a vision of the likeness of man; since at Mount Sinai, He appeared like an elder sitting in an academy and at the Sea, He appeared like a mighty warrior and it is [also] written (Ezekiel 1:26), \"Upon the... throne was the likeness of a man;\" as it is in all of these [types of] visions, that He, may He be blessed, was accustomed to be seen. And about this [manner of appearance as well], it is possible that He said, \"in our image, according to our likeness,\" even though, in truth, He, may He be blessed, has no likeness; and 'it is the glory of God to hide the thing.'  ", 
                "<b>\"And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the animals:\"</b> And later the order is reversed, as it is stated (Genesis 9:2),  And your fear and your dread shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird... and upon all the fishes of the sea,\" and also David reversed the order and stated (Psalms 8:7-9), \"And You have given him mastery over the works of Your hands, everything have You placed under his feet. Sheep and cattle, all of them, and also the animals of the field. The birds of the sky and the fish of the sea, the ones that travel the paths of the seas.\" And also here it states, \"let them have dominion,\" but in Parshat Noach [above], it did not mention dominion, and also David stated, \"You have given him mastery,\" and this change [in wording,] does it not matter?", 
                "And it seems most likely to me to say about this, that concerning these three types, man has greater power to rule over one than over the other. And behold, he can rule the most over the beasts and the wild animals and all that crawls on the ground, since they are found with him; and man can go after them to all of the places that they go - [to] and fro - and run to; which is not the case with birds and fish, since man cannot fly in the air or walk down to the bottom of the seas. And nonetheless, he has more power over the birds than over the fish, since man can, at least, see to where they are flying and chase after them or shoot his arrows and astound them; which is not the case with the fish, since they are covered by the sea, and so] they have two disadvantages [for man's control; not being seen and being inaccessible.] Therefore, here - where it states, \"let them have dominion\" [<i> veyirdu</i>] which is understood [also] as an expression of descent [<i>yeridah</i>], that if [man] does not merit [to have dominion,] he will be in descent in front of [the animals] and not be able [to control] them at all - it mentions the [three different types] in the manner of 'not just this, but even that;' and started with the fish of the sea [to say] 'not just' that [man] will not control them - as this is not such a novelty, since he cannot go to the place that the fish are going [and] also his eye has no mastery over them [to see them]  - 'but even' the birds, which he can see as they flee from before him; nonetheless, he will not control them [either]. And [so too] 'not [just'] the birds, 'but even' the beasts he will not control. But in Parshat Noach, and also [with] King David, [the verses] don't mention an expression of dominion, but rather an expression of fear and [being] below and governance - the understanding of which does not convey any expression of descent - if so, [these verses] are certainly speaking about a time when man [is meritorious], and so, he controls them. Hence, it mentions them [also] in the way of 'not just this, but even that' but in reverse order: 'not just that he will control those that walk on the ground, 'but even' the birds; and 'not just' the birds, which he can at least see, 'but even' the fish; and it is easy to understand."

                "<b>And God saw all that He had made and behold, it was very good:</b> Even though [the Torah] already mentioned \"that it was good\" in the creation of each and every day, nonetheless, here it repeated it and said, \"behold, it was very good\" after the creation of man, to teach that all of the creations were not created but for the sake of man. And even though it is stated, \"that it was good\" for all of them, it was stated based on the future; but they were not yet in their completeness and 'goodness' until man - for whose sake they came into existence - was created. Then [God] saw and said, \"behold, it was very good.\" And you should know that there is a difference between [the phrase,] \"that it was good\" and [the phrase,] \"behold, it was very good;\" as the word, that [<i>ki</i>], is one of doubt, as if it is not certain; since behold, in every place the word, <i>ki</i>, relates to a doubt; because the word, <i>ki</i>, relates to time - as in \"<i>ki tetseh</i>\" [\"when you go out\"] and \"<i>ki tavo</i>\" [\"when you come in\"]; which means to say that [the phrase,] \"And God saw that [<i>ki</i>] it was good\" means that God was looking ahead, when the time will come that the nature of their goodness would be revealed; but \"behold, it was very good\" indicates certainty. And our Rabbis, of blessed memory, stated in a midrash [Bereshit Rabbah 8:5] that the Holy One, blessed be He debated with the angels whether or not to create man; and if the judgment had been not to create man, the existence of all the previous [creations] would have been for naught. Hence it states about them, \"that it was good\" which indicates a doubt, but when man was created, then they became certainly good; that is why it [then] states \"all that He had made and <i>behold</i>, it was... good;\" the word, behold, indicates the time of the present, at which man appeared; and then the 'goodness' and beauty of all the previous beings became seen retroactively. And it added [the word,] very, here, which was not mentioned earlier, to teach that through man, they were made very good; [and a] hint to this is that [the word,] very [<i>me'od</i>] is [made up of the same] letters [as the word,] man [<i>adam</i>].", 
                "And it can also be explained through the metaphor of the eating of fish and meat, each of which is good by itself, but if they are mixed, they become bad; and these creations, it wasn't only that they were good by themselves, but even when they were all joined together, they were also good, and this is [what it means when] it states, \"all that He had made and behold, it was very good.\"", 
                "<b>The sixth day:</b> [The Torah] added [a letter], <i>hay</i> to the word, sixth, to say that the Holy One, blessed be He, made a condition with [his creations] that it all depends on whether Israel will accept the five [the numerical equivalent of the letter <i>hay</i>] books of the Torah; or that all of you will be in suspension until the sixth day of Sivan [when the Jews accepted the Torah], since <i>hey</i>, when it is spelled out, comes out to [the number, six.] And the reason for this matter is because the upper ones and the lower ones are two opposites, and they cannot exist [together] except through an intermediary that combines and unites these two opposite elements; and this is man who has a physical part and a spiritual part - \"a part of God above;\" and the retention of the spiritual side depends on the acceptance of the Torah. If so, if Israel had not accepted the Torah, there would not be any intermediary here to to unite the two opposite extremes and necessity would dictate that the world would return to being chaos and void. And don't answer me from the time period before the receiving of the Torah, since there were always righteous ones involved in Torah, like Noach, Shem and Ever and the forefathers and [others] similar to them; and with them was the great Name [of God, the numerical value of which] is made up of the number, twenty six. Therefore the world stood for twenty six generations without Torah among the masses; but after twenty-six generations, when the number of the Name was finished, there was not [any longer enough] strength among the individuals of the generations to preserve the worlds, except through the acceptance of the Torah.  Therefore, one who is involved with the Torah brings peace to the retinue above and below [Sanhedrin 99b] and this matter will be explained more later in Parshat Ha'azinu, with the help of God.", 
                "And [about] that which the world was created specifically in six days, the commentators say that it is a hint to the time of the preservation of this world, that it will be six thousand [years], two thousand [years] of chaos, without Torah - corresponding to this, there are two [letters,] <i>aleph</i> [which is the same spelling as the Hebrew for 'thousand'] in the verse, \"and the earth was chaos;\" two thousand [years with] Torah - corresponding to this, there are two [letters,] <i>aleph</i> in the verse (Exodus 13:9), \"in order that the Torah of your Lord be in your mouth;\" and two thousand [years] of the days of the messiah - corresponding to this, there are two [letters,] <i>aleph</i> in the verse (Genesis 49:10), \"until he will come to Shilo;\" and this is correct. And other commentators were precise in [seeing the] creation of each and every day as corresponding to a millennium, one after the other, and we cannot elaborate about them [here.] And there are those that say that it is for [the following] reason that the <i>hay</i> is added on the sixth day, because the world was created with the [letter,] <i>hay</i>, and after the end of the work, the Holy One, blessed be He, deposited the instrument of his work with the sixth day and did not want that it should be with Him on Shabbat, so that [people] would learn from here that every craftsman should deposit his instruments with the sixth [day.]", 
                "<b>The sixth day. And He finished the skies:</b> [The Torah] mentioned the Name of four [letters by way of] the first letters of these four words, [<i>yom hashishi vayekhulu hashamayim</i>; which] agrees with what I explained above about the reason of the twenty-six generations. And according to the simple explanation, it ended the story of the creation with the name of God that is a combination of [a letter from each of the words for] man [<i>yud</i>] and woman [<i>hay</i>]. This agrees with the words of our Rabbis, of blessed memory (Bava Batra 74b), \"Everything that the Holy One, blessed be He, created in this world,  male and female, He created them;\" and it is stated (Isaiah 26:4), \"Through the Power [spelled <i>yud-hay</i>] God, the Rock of the Worlds\" - by which, I mean that everything that He created in this world, in all of them, there is a likeness to the male and the female together. Since all males are a likeness of the emanator and all females are a likeness of the receiver; and all creations all have a side that emanates and a side that receives, [that are both] together in one. How is this: Behold, the Holy One, blessed be He is the first Emanator, who gives emanating words to the higher world, but He, may He be blessed, does not receive from [any] other; and the higher world, in turn, emanates to the middle world - it comes out that the higher world has the likeness of the male and the female together, as behold, it receives like a female from the first Cause, may He be blessed, and emanates like a male to the middle world; and so [too,] the middle world receives the emanation of the higher world and, in turn, emanates to the lower world. If [this is] so, also the middle world, is called male and female both together, emanating and receiving. And the lower ones, even though they are receiving and not emanating, nonetheless they have a likeness to the male in them, given that all that exist below need each other, some of them giving and some of them taking; and they also have actual males and females, like all of the animals; such that in all of them, it is appropriate to say that it is emanating and receiving both together - except for God alone, that to Him we can only attribute maleness, emanating and not receiving. This is what the Rabbis, of blessed memory, stated in several midrashic statements (Sotah 42b), \"There is no man except the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated (Exodus 15:3), 'The Lord is a man of war;'\" which means to say that we cannot attribute [maleness] which indicates an emanator who does not [also] receive, except to God alone, since all need Him, may He be blessed, and He does not need any of them. ", 
                "And [about] that which we find the word, man, with reference to the creations, it is not an essential [usage of the word] but rather as [a metaphor, in  comparison] with a woman, but the essential [use] of the word, man, can not be related to [anything] but He, may He be blessed. Therefore, [the Torah] ends the entire story of creation on the sixth day with the name of the Power [<i>yod-hay</i>] that is a combination of the [letters] of the male and female; to teach that God created them all male and female [together in one.] Hence, in this world, the creatures do not use his full name [that extends to all four letters and not just the first two,] but rather the name [that only includes the first two letters, <i>yod-hay</i>,] but in the world to come - 'the day that is completely Shabbat,' then they will use the full name, since 'the dead may not praise the Power [<i>yod-hay</i>].' If so, [the second set of letters,] <i>vav-hay</i>, is hinted by the first letters of the words, \"and He completed the skies,\" that speak about the day of Shabbat in what's revealed [exoteric] and hint to the hidden [esoteric] things - to the world to come; to teach that [only] then will the Name be complete. And so [too,] David ended the psalm (Psalms 103), \"Bless my soul\" - all of which speaks about the formation of creation - with the name of the Power, and see also later, Parshat Re'eh, on the verse (Deuteronomy 15:10), \"Because of this thing.\""
