            "The king of the world, who ruled before any creature was created. At the time they were made, all was according to His will, and then His name was called \"King\". And after everything was finished, he alone ruled, awe-inspiring. He was, He is, and He will be with splendor. And, he was first, with no second, to rule over him or to collaborate; with no beginning and no end, he has the strength and the right. And he is my G-d, my redeemer is alive; the rock who sustains me in a distressful day. And he is my banner and refuge, the portion of my cup on the day I call out. In his hand, I safegaurd my spirit, [for] when I sleep, [I know that] I will wake. And with my spirit is my body; G-d is for me, and I will not be afraid. ", 
            "May the living G-d be exalted, and praised, it is found that there is no specific time to find him [for he is eternal]. He is one, and there is none as unified as his unity; it is hidden, and there is also no end to his unity. He has no bodily form, and no body; his holiness has not been ordered for him. He is earlier than anything which he created, [He is] the first and there is none before His earliness. He is surely the lord of the world, to all being, and He teaches his greatness and kingship. An abundance of prophecy He gave to them, his special and splendorous people. There never again arose in Israel like Moses, a prophet and seer of His image. A truthful instruction, G-d gave to His people, by the hand of his prophet who was trustworthy in His house. The G-d will not change, nor will he switch His belief, forever [there is none] except for Him. He watches and knows our secrets, and looks at the end of something at its beginning. He recompensates people with kindness, according to their deeds, and gives the wicked bad according to his evil. At the end of days, He will send our annointed, to redeem those who wait for the end [when] His salvation [takes place]. The dead will G-d resuscitate, in his abundant kindness, blessed be His praised name forever.",

            "And may it be pleasing before You, Hashem our G-d and the G-d of our forefathers, that you make us accustomed in your Torah, and make us stick to your commandments. And that You do not bring us not to the hands of sin, nor to the hands of transgression and wrongdoing, nor to the hands of trial, and nor to the hands of scorn. And let not the evil inclination rule inside us, and distance us from a bad person and a bad friend. And stick us to the good inclination and to good deeds, and force our inclination to be subdued to You. And grant us today and every day grace and kindness and mercy, in your eyes an in the eyes of all who see us, and reward us with good kindnesses. Blessed are You, Hashem, who rewards good kindnesses upon His nation, Israel. May it be pleasing before You, Hashem my G-d and the G-d of my forefathers, that save us today and every day from those who are arrogant and from arrogance itself, from a bad person, a bad friend, a bad neighbor, a bad strike, from the destructive Satan, from a harsh law and from a harsh judge, whether he is a son of the covenant or whether he is not a son of the covenant.",
