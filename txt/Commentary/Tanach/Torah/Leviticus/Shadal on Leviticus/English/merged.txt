"Do not bear a grudge ("titur")..." According to the simplest understanding, the grudge is [a form of] revenge after a period of time, similar to [Nahum 1:2] "and he bears a grudge for his enemies." (R. Naftali Hirz Wessely)
All other transgressions against one's fellow man are objectively immoral, except for revenge, which seems like justice. Therefore, 'love your fellow as yourself.' Just like you don't want others to take revenge on you, so you should not take revenge on your fellow, even though you are in the right to take revenge. And so too in all other ways you should love your fellow as you love yourself. And Moses Mendelssohn interpreted it as "You shall love your fellow in all the ways of love that you love yourself," equal in quality of love and not in its quantity, whenever there is no conflict between two beloved things. However, that's similar to the trait of a Sodomite (what's mine is mine and what's yours is yours [Pirkei Avot 5:10]), for how can I benefit my fellow without causing myself loss or effort, light or heavy? For there will always be a conflict between my benefit and other people's benefit, and there is no way to give a perutah to my friend without losing a perutah from my pocket.
