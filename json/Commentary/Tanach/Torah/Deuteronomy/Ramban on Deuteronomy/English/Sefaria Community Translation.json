                "\"Bechol Levavcha\" according to the midrash (Sifri), the heart is mentioned here because it is the force that desires (lit.), as it is written [in Tehillim 21:3], \"the desire of his heart You gave to him,\" [and also is written in Mishlei 6:25], \"do not covet her beauty in your heart.\" If so, \"bechol nafshecha\" - the \"nefesh\"* is [the organ that] reasons, as it is written [in Shmuel 1 25:29] \"the Nefesh of my master shall be bound up in the binding of life.\" It is also like the words of our sages who expound in the Gemara [in Brachot 54]", 
                "**Note that Nefesh is commonly translated as \"soul\" but is more properly rendered in the original as \"life\". However, the use here in the midrash is referring to what we might refer to as a person's \"mind\" but seems to bring a proof quote referring to David's \"life.\""

                "So that his heart not become haughty over his brothers: here is hinted in the Torah the prohibition of arrogance, because the Torah restrains the king from arrogance and haughtiness of heart, and how much more so the others that would not be fitting for this--because for one who would be fitting for raising and aggrandizing, it warns him that his heart must be low and humble like all his lesser brothers. Because arrogance is a character trait which is disgusting and abhorrent by Hashem, even in a king, because to Hashem alone is the greatness and highness, and to Him alone is the praise, and only through Him can a man boast, as the topic is explained by Shlomo Hamelech (Mishlei): The abhorrence of Hashem is all who are haughty of heart, and it is written (Yirmiyahu): but only through this should a man boast: of knowing Me..."

                "As he conspired, but not as he did. From here the sages said : If [the court] executed him [by the testimony of the false witnesses] they are not executed. This is is quoted from Rashi who quotes the sages (Mokkos 5b)",

                "Additionally, God would not allow the righteous judges that stand before him to shed innocent blood \"for the judgement is God's\" and, \"in the midst of the judges He judges.\" This is the tremendous eminence of the judges of Israel and the guarantee that the Holy One, blessed be He, agrees with them and is \"with them, in matters of judgement\"."

                "Because they met you not with bread and with water we find (Deut. 2:28-29) \"Thou shalt sell me food for money that I might eat and give me water for money that I might drink ... as the children of Esau who dwell in Se'ir and the Moabites who dwell in Ar\" and many say that they did not go forth to them, but Israel bought from them, and this is foolishness, because it is sufficient for the camp that they are sold food when they want to buy it, and also because Israel did enter the border of Moab and the Moabites took out bread and water for them in exchange for money, and the text will tell that the Moabites did as the sons of Esau did, and why should the Moabite be forever banished for this and the Edomite not be so despised, and Rabbi Avraham says (Deut. 2:29) that the reason it says \"as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto me\" on the passage through their country on the way (Deut. 2:27) but did not sell them bread and water since they passed Har Seir and Ar, only the king of Edom did not allow them to pass through the land in which he dwells, and this is what it says (Num. 20:18) \"you will not pass through me\" and this too is foolishness because they said to the king of Edom  We will pass through your land and Edom refused to let Israel pass through their borders (Num. 20:21) thus they did not at all enter the border of Edom, and thus it says (Num. 21:4) \"They travelled from Hor Hahar through the Red Sea to circle the land of Edom\" because they needed to return through the Red Sea from Hor Hahar which is on the border of the land of Edom and they did not enter the land of Edom at all, and Yiftach said in his explanation (Judges 11:16-18) \"But when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh; then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying: Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh; Then he walked through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they pitched on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.\" Here it is explicit that they did not enter at all into the land of Edom nor into the land of Moab and if they had entered there they would have been sold bread and water since it is not the custom to allow a people's army to pass through the land and not have bread and water sold to them, and it seems to me that the pasuk distanced these two brothers who recieved kindness from Avraham who saved their father and mother from the sword and cativity (Gen. 14:16) and in whose merit God sent them from the destruction (Gen. 19:29) and they owed kindness to Israel, but they did them an ill turn, the one by hiring Bilam ben Be'or, and those are the Moabites, and the other who did not recieve them with bread and water when Israel approached them, as it says (Deut. 2:18-19) you are passing today the border of Moav, Ar, and approaching Bnei Ammon, and here the verse warns them (Deut. 2:19) Don't harass them and don't contend with them and they didn't welcome them at all, since then the verse would have said \"as the sons of Esau, the Moabites and the Ammonites did\", but the Ammonites are not mentioned since they did not welcome them, and thus Ammon was more wicked than the others, since the sons of Esau and the Moabites, when they knew that Israel would not contend with them, brought out bread and water outside their borders, and Ammon did not deign to do so, and this is the reason for |\"who did not welcome them\", that they did not go forth towards them with bread and water as the others did, and therefore the verse mentioned the \"Ammonite\" first, and mentioned his crime first, that they didn't welcome them, and only then mentioned the \"Moabite\" and their sin. Chazal learned (Yebamot 76) an Ammonite male, and not an Ammonite femal, a Moabite male and not a Moabite female since the way of the man is to go forth, and the way of the woman is not to go forth to bring food outside the borders of the country, and it is also written in the Yerushalmi ( Yebamot perek 8 halacha 3) and in Rut Rabati (4:8) since the way  of the man is to hire, and it is not the way of the woman to hire."

And this is the explanation of \"and learn to fear\" (verse 13) - that it is in the future, since above [concerning the men and the women], it states, \"and they will learn and fear\" [immediately as they learn].
