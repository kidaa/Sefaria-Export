            "(1) IN ORDER TO SERVE HIS CREATOR - because for this was man created. As the text says \"Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory... \" And even if his Evil Inclination advises him in the winter and says 'How will you arise in the morning, because it is very cold?' or in the summer advises and says 'How will you arise from your bed, when you still have not slept to your satisfaction?' Overcome him and do not listen to him, and think to yourself: If I had needed to arise to appear before a king of flesh and blood, how carefully and zealously would I arise and awaken in order to prepare myself for this service? All the more so and obviously, before the King of kings the Holy One blessed is He. ", 
            "(2) THE DAWN - A secret in written in the Two Tablets of the Covenant, to connect the day and night with Torah and prayer, whether its morning or whether its evening. Immediately upon waking up from sleep if he doesn't plan to sleep more, he should wash his hands, even if he is does so while still lying down. All the more so, he shouldn't walk four cubits without having washed his hands. He must be very careful in this regard. And the holy Zohar emphasizes the great punishment for this, for leaving the spirit of impurity on himself. In any case, he should not God forbid violate any other prohibition in order to not have a gap before washing his hands; like for instance, to stop himself from urinating for this purpose, or to take water which his friend had prepared for himself, if its not obvious to him that he will immediately be able to give him other [water] in exchange. And there are those who fail in this. And if he sees that the water is far and he doesn't have someone to bring it close to him, it is the custom of some of the observant ones (ba'alei ha'nefesh) to walk little by little in increments shorter than four cubits. The Sha'arei Teshuvah write about this that its better if hes able to run and not allow the spirit of evil to linger on his hands. There are those who say in regards to this idea that the entire house is like his four cubits, but we shouldn't rely on this unless in a time of pressure. If when he arises at night he sees that he does not have enough water to wash his hands three times as it appropriate to rid the spirit of impurity, nevertheless he should not God forbid forgo his Torah study because of this until daylight, but rather he should wash his hands a little or clean his hands on whatever he has to wash, make a blessing, and learn, as per the law of the Talmud and Torah. ", 
            "(3) WHEN THE GROUP IS PRAYING - Even though the time for prayer has not passed, in any case he is commanded to pray with a group. This is elaborated below at the end of Seif Katan 9.", 
            "THE RIGHTEOUS - He should paint in his soul/mind always how to stand before Hashem blessed be his name, because The Holy One's glory fills all the land. And it is written in the name of the Arizal, that he should always paint the name YHV'H next to his eyes in the essence of Fear of Heaven, for this is Y-H-V-H (with the vowelization of the word Fear [YIR'AH]), for this is the secret of \"I shall set the Lord before me always\" and the is greatly benefits one's Fear of Heaven. There are those who are accustomed because of this to have parchments of a Menorah drawn inside their Siddurim, on which it is written \"I shall set the Lord...\" Etc..., with the Four Letters and other Names, and this Menorah is called \"I have set\" [\"Shiviti\"]. And the purpose is in order to remind one not to engage in idle chatter during God fearing prayer. And it is written in the Gates of Repentance [Sha'arei Teshuvah] ", 
            "(5)  BEFORE MEN - Never the less, he should never fight with them, because the quality of brazenness is very despicable, and its not appropriate to use it at all, even in the service of the Lord blessed be his name, because he the will acquire the attribute in his personality even in matters which are not in the service of Hashem. ", 
            "THAT ARE MOCKING YOU - If he's an average person who in the company of great men, he shouldn't be embarrassed to learn or to do the mitzvah. If its possible for him to perform it not directly in their presence, its even better. However, if you're in the presence of other average folk who would learn from him, then on could say, that it would be better to do it in their presence, so that they should learn from him how do as he has done. However, he should direct his heart [intention] to the Name of the Heaven, but not boastfully God forbid. ", 
            "AND WHEN HE IS ALONE - It means to say, even when he is in the privacy of his home, also he should be walking with the Lord his God, as [the Re'ma] concludes...", 
            "WITH ALACRITY - Not exactly, bur rather he should wait a bit and not get up immediately, because it is damaging for the body. It is good to say immediately upon rising \"I am gratefully to you my eternal king who has returned my soul in kindess; great is your faith.\" It should be said with a pause after \"kindness\", and \"great of your faith\" without pause. And this is from as its written \"renewal of mornings\" etc..., that the Holy One Blessed be He upholds his faithfulness to returns the souls to its depositor in the morning. "

            "But Now etc: Because we do not have the presumption of being God fearing such that angels would be escorting us and that we would ask of them to wait for us until we exit.", 
            "Until Sitting: And in the same way, he shouldn't get up while he is revealed.", 
            "And Should Not Go (Together): And if he's afraid, one can put his hand on his head through the window, but only if he won't see his uncovering (Mishnah Brura: Siman 3, Seif 8), and it's even forbidden to enter with his wife, but with a small child who doesn't know, it's allowed to enter the bathroom.", 
            "And Should Not Speak: And if it's for a great need, it's allowed, as long as he isn't excusing himself. But while he is still excusing himself, even for a great need, it's forbidden. And if there's another person, close the door, and another man wants to enclose himself at the same time as him, they shouldn't speak. Only women talk when they go to a specific bathroom that is in public, like a bathroom that was in the field, back in the day, or in the courtyard of the synagogue. In these countries, the Sages said that they should talk to each other in order for their voices to be heard from outside, so a man won't enclose himself there and be alone with them (Sanhedrin 19), and therefore from there, they (women) go in twos to the bathroom."

And our rabbis spoke highly of the importance of this mitzvah (in Shabbat 118)... And similarly in every location, one should delight in Shabbat according to the custom, with food and drink that is considered delight for them.

Be very careful to not bathe for the mitzvah and have the concern of violating Shabbos. And with many sins, many fail in this in the winter days and short days that if wait a short amount, it will get dark. And even if you complete your washing permissibly, also be careful of a prohibition because at times you will comb your hair afterwards, which is a Torah violation of Shabbos. Also another thing that's found is to squeeze out the towel from the water that it was holding. This is the prohibition of M'chabeis (laundering). It is proper for all who fear god with their hearts, to warn the nation not to do this. And their is a principle that if the nation does a sin you could've stopped, you also recieve punishment. However, if you stop the nation from doing this, you are also rewarded. If you don't stop the people in your house, you get the sin of the people in your house.

There is a custom to stand trees in the synagogues and homes in remembrance that on Shavuot judgment takes place for the fruits of the tree.

            "We are obliged to fast, etc.  This obligation derives from the words of the prophets, as it is written in Scripture (Zech. 8:19), \"The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth...\" Our Sages, may their memories be for a blessing, explained that \"the fast of the fourth\" is the 17th of Tammuz, since it is in the fourth month according to the way we count the months; that \"the fast of the fifth\" is the Tish'ah B'Av [the 9th of Av], since it is in the fifth month; that \"the fast of the seventh\" is the Fast of Gedalia, since it is in the seventh month [Tishrei]; and that \"the fast of the tenth\" is the 10th of Tevet, since it is in the tenth month.  On all of these days, all Israel fasts because of the misfortunes that befell them on these days, in order to arouse their hearts to open up to the paths of repentance [teshuvah].  This [fasting] will be a recollection of our evil deeds and the deeds of our ancestors which were like our deeds now, such that they caused them--and us--these misfortunes, and in the recollection of these things we will return [nashuv] to become better [people], as it is written (Lev. 26:40), \"And they will confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their ancestors...\"  Therefore, each person is obliged to take to heart on these days to examine their deeds and to repent [lashuv] of them, because the fast [itself] is not the essential [thing], as it is written [in Jonah 3:10] about the people of Nineveh: \"And the Eternal saw their deeds, that they repented [turned back] from their evil path...\" The Sages, may their memories be a blessing, said that their sackcloth and their fasting were not mentioned--just their deeds.  Fasting is nothing but a preparation for repentance.  Therefore, those people who, as they are fasting, go on walks or [pursue] trivial matters grasp the issue of secondary importance, but loses track of the essence.  But in any case, one may not exempt oneself by means of repentance alone, because to fast on these days is a positive commandment from the prophets, as we wrote above.", 
            "On account of the terrible things, etc. Because on 17 Tammuz five misfortunes occurred.  On it, the tablets were broken as Moses descended from the mountain, as is explained in the Torah [Ex. 32:19]; the daily offering was cancelled and was no longer sacrificed in the First Temple; [the walls of] the city [of Jerusalem] were breached [in advance] of the destruction of the Second Temple; the evil Apostomos burnt the Torah; and an idol was placed in the Holy Temple.  On on 9 Av, the great destruction occurred. The First Temple was destroyed on [that day], as was the Second; and on that very day it was decreed that our ancestors that were in the desert would not enter the land; and on that very day, [Romans] conquered a great town, called Beytar [during the Bar Kokhba revolt], which was home to thousands of Jews, all of whom fell into the hands of the idolaters and all of whom perished, which was a calamity as great as the destruction of the Temple; and on this very day, destined for calamity, the evil Turnusrufus plowed the Temple and its environs, thus fulfilling what was said: \"Zion will be plowed as a field\" (Jer. 26:18). And on the day of 3 Tishrei, Gedalia son of Ahikam was murdered.  He had been appointed to lead the remaining survivors after the the [first] destruction [and his death led to] the extinguishing of the remaining embers of Israel, because [in the wake of it] all were exiled and thousands were killed. And on 10 Tevet, the evil king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar assaulted Jerusalem and laid it under the siege and distress that led to the destruction."

In any case, even someone who needs to eat should not feast on meat and wine, but [should eat] only what they need.  And likewise, children who understand [enough] to mourn: although we are not obliged to educate them [to fast] even at age twelve and even for a fast of a few hours, it is in any case appropriate to educate them to eat just enough to sustain their bodies, water and other simple food as they require, in order that they will mourn with the community.", 
            "We are permitted to wash ourselves... Because at the time when [Israel] wished [to fast] and accepted upon themselves the obligation to fast on all four of these fasts, they did not accept upon themselves that [all four] would be as stringent a public fast as Tish'ah Be'Av, because the majority of the community would not be able to stand it.  So a pious person should be stringent on all of them as on Tish'ah Be'Av, but if one of them falls on the evening when [a man's wife is due to] immerse [after her period], he should fulfill his obligation [to have marital relations].  Likewise, a person should not be strict about wearing shoes in order not to be a laughingstock. Likewise, if the 10th of Tevet falls on Friday, a person should not be strict about not washing in hot water out of respect for Shabbat.",

Chazal teach that it's a mitzvah from the Torah to eat on erev Yom Kippur and ha-kadosh-baruch-hu wishes to bestow rewar for the feasting as if it were fasting.
