                "1) I say: Since this tractate is not founded on the exegesis of commandments of the Torah’s mitzvot, like the rest of the tractates which are in the Mishna, but is rather wholly morals and principles, and whereas the sages of the (other) nations of the world have also composed books according to the inspiration of their hearts, concerning moral paths, how a person should behave with his fellow; therefore, in this tractate the tanna began ‘Moses received Torah from Sinai,’ to tell you that the principles and morals which are in this tractate were not inspired by the hearts of the Mishna’s sages; rather, they too were stated at Sinai.", 
                "From Sinai: From the One who was revealed at Sinai.", 
                "To the elders: who lived long after Joshua, and those elders (passed it) to other elders until they reached the beginning of the prophets, who are Eli the priest and Samuel of Ramah.", 
                "To the men of the Great Assembly: There were 120 elders, (including) Zerubbel, Seraiah, Re’elaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan,  who in the days of Ezra were the ones who emigrated from the diaspora in (the period of) the second Temple. Included among them were Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi and Nehemiah ben Hachliah  and their associates. They were called the Great Assembly since they restored the crown to its original splendor (Yoma 69b),  for Moses said “The great, mighty and awesome God (Deut. 10:17).”  Jeremiah and Daniel came but did not say, “Mighty and awesome (Jer. 32:18) (Dan. 9:4),”  but they restored it as in the beginning, since they indeed stated both his might and his awesomeness.  For were it not so, how could a nation such as this be able to endure in the presence of so many nations.", 
                "They stated three things: They stated many things; rather, they said these three things because they contain within them the establishment of Torah.", 
                "Be discerning in judgment: Where if a case comes before you one, two or three (times), do not say ‘This case already came before me, and (I ruled) a second and a third time.’ Rather, ‘Be discerning,’ which is say they wait before they decide the case. ", 
                "Raise up many students: (This is meant) to exclude (the words of) Rabban Gamliel, who said ‘Any student whose exterior is not like his interior shall not enter the Beit Midrash (Brakh.28a).’  We derive from this that we teach Torah to every person; there is no need to inquire after him. Simply put, he should not be known from a single instance that his actions are defiled or that he has a bad reputation. Alternately, we may derive that if he raises up disciples in his youth, he will do so in his old age, as “Sow your seed in the morning, and in the evening do not hold back your hand (Eccl 11:6) (Yev. 62b)”  is written.", 
                "Establish a fence for the Torah: A hedge, in order that he not come into contact with a Torah prohibition, such as second degree sexual relationships or the secondary laws of rest for Shabbat  as “You shall keep my charge” is written; (read it:) ‘Make a safeguard for my safeguard (Lev. 18:30).’"

                "Among the remnants: Among those remaining, for after they had all died, the tradition remained in his possession. He was High Priest following Ezra.", 
                "He used to say: Which is to say ‘Such was regularly in his mouth.’  And so too every (instance) of ‘Rabbi x says’ (or) ‘He used to say’ which is in this tractate; their meaning is ‘He was accustomed to saying such a thing regularly.’", 
                "The world stands: The world was only created for the sake of these three things.", 
                "On Torah: Had Israel not received Torah the heavens and the earth would not have been created, as “As surely as I have established my covenant with day and night, the laws of heaven and earth (Jer. 33:25) (Shab. 88a)” is written.", 
                "On Temple service: The service of the sacrifices. For such have we taught in tractate Ta’anit:  ‘Were it not for the pillars the heavens and the earth would not have endured (Ta'an. 27b).’ And we have found that on account of the sacrifices that Noah brought, the Holy One blessed is He promised that He would never bring a flood.  So it is that the world stands upon the sacrifices. ", 
                "On acts of lovingkindness: As “The world is built up by your kindness (Ps. 89:3)” is written.  And such is loving kindness: To regale grooms and to comfort mourners, to visit the sick and inter the dead, and the like."

                "\"Every controversy that is in the name of Heaven, the end thereof will endure.\" That is to say that the people of controversy are destined to endure and not be destroyed, as with the dispute between Hillel and Shammai that were not destroyed. Neither they nor the students of Hillel and Shammai. But Korach and his band perished.", 
                "(2.)  And I heard the explanation of “the end,” –'its purpose', and 'the matter that is needed'. The controversy which is for the sake of Heaven, the purpose and aim is to arrive at the truth, and this endures, as they said that from a disagreement the truth will be revealed, as was revealed in the disputes between Hillel and Shammai - that the law was like the school of Hillel. And a controversy which is not for the sake of Heaven, its purpose is to achieve power and the love of victory, and its end will not continue endure, as we find in the disagreement of Korach and his band--their aim and intent was a lust for honor and power, and the opposite was achieved.\n"
