Tosefta Yoma

Chapter 1

Why do they separate the Kohen Gadol from his household to Lishkat Parhedrin. The explanation of Rabbi Yehuda Ben Betira is that he may be with his wife, and there is a doubt as to whether she is a Niddah and he would become impure in the seven days before Yom Kippur. There was another reading that he was taken to Lishkat Barvatan.
..All the chambers in the Beit Hamikdash were exempt from mezuzah aside from Lishkat Parhedrin because it was a residence for the Kohen Gadol seven days a year. Rabbi Yehudah said if it wasn't a living space there, all living spaces are obligated..
