Ramban on Exodus

Chapter 1



Verse 1

The reason for "And these are the names" is that the verse wants to tell the topic of the exile from the time of their descent to Egypt because then was the initial exile, as I have explained. Therefore, it returns to the original topic which [originally was mentioned] in the verse, "And [Jacob] brought all his descendants with him to Egypt" (Genesis 46:7). Afterwards it says there, "And these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt etc." This very verse it what is being repeated here, because even though they are two separate books (Genesis and Exodus), the story is connected with things that
...And Rabbi Avraham (the Ibn Ezra) said that since it mentioned at the end of the first Book that Joseph saw to his sons 30 descendants, it mentions that also his brothers when they came down were few and they multiplied and became many, and this isn't correct. And Rashi wrote that even though it counted them in their life-time, it repeated and counted them after their death by name to make known their endearment, that they are compared to starts that He takes out by counting and puts them back by counting, as it says "who removes them by the number of their hosts, to all He calls by name." And these are the words of the Medrash. And these are words of truth on the topic of the love that Hashem has and it often says their names multiple times. But the connection of the Pesukim and their connection with a 'Vov' is as I explained.

"Let us scheme against them" Pharaoh and his advisers did not decide to smite them with the sword, because that would be a great betrayal, to smite a nation that has come to the land on the command of the first king. Even the common people wouldn't give consent to the king to do such a crime, for he advises with them, and additionally the nation of Israel was numerous and mighty and would fight back in a great war. Rather he advised that they should act cleverly so that Israel should not feel that he is acting out of hate, and therefore he levied a tax on them, for it is common for foreigners to pay a tax to the king, as is seen by Solomon (Kings 1, 9:21)

Chapter 2



Verse 1



Verse 2

ותרא SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GOOD AND SHE HID HIM: The explanation that she hid him because of [something special] that she saw in him is false. All babies elicit the compassion of their mothers. Rather one must explain [the verb] SHE SAW (ותרא) like in the verse (Gen. 1:31), "God saw (יארע) all that he had made and found it very good." There the phrase means that [God] looked and examined all His works and His actions that He had done to see whether there was something to correct therein; everything was proper and correct. Here also, since Moses was born [prematurely] after [a pregnancy of only] six months--just as we find that Samuel was born [after a six-month pregnancy, as it is written (I Sam. 1:20) לתקופות הימים i.e. after two tequfot and two [more] days.
That is why she [Moses' mother] was able to hide him for three months, for the Egyptians used to check the pregnant women [only at the anticipated end of a full term pregnancy] at the end of nine months.
Accordingly, [since he was born so prematurely] she examined him when he was born to see whether he was a stillborn that need not be hidden. But she saw that he was fine and good-looking, for his signs of maturity, which are his hair and fingernails--as we learned in Yevamot (80b )--were completed. So she knew that he was capable of surviving and therefore she hid him for three months--i.e. until the end of [what would have been a pregnancy of nine months, which is the standard length of pregnancy for most women. When they came to check on her either she told them that the child had been a stillborn or that the Egyptians had already thrown him into the river.

Verse 3

..I did not understand why Hashem had to do miracles for Moshe, because Moshe trusted that it was Hashem speaking to him, (why did he have to prove himself.) It would have been appropriate to say, the stick that you are holding in your hand, throw down in front of them and it will become a snake. So too for the second sign, it should have been done the way it was done in the third: take the water when youre in front of them. And therefore the rabbi say that the first one was a sign that he was speaking gossip and the second one was to punish him for it. 
And that is the reason Moshe ran away from the snake because he was scared that he might be punished and the snake would bit him, and most people run away from things that are harmful to them. Even though, he knew that if he will be in G-d's favor he will not need to be saved. 
And maybe, even though Hashem the creator of the world came to him, Hashem wanted to show these symbols in the change of nature. In order to strengthen the matter and the belief in Moshe's heart. And he should know truthfully that only via G-d's hand that new things will happen in this world. And it was enough for Moshe to just show him two things and there was no water there, so therefore he commanded that the sign should be done when theres water, in the eyes of the Jewish people.

...In the hand of who you usually send and this is Ahron. Another opinion, with another hand of who you want them to be sent for my destiny is not to lead them into the land of Israel and to be their redeemer in the future. You have a lot of other messengers, these are the words of Rashi. And Onkelos says, send it in the hand of someone who is appropriate to go (like a general or ambassador), meaning, send with someone who can speak eloquently who is appropriate for this honorable task. And don't send someone who cannot speak well, who you will have to talk for. Because it is not a way of respect to send someone who has problems speaking, no ones going to listen when you speak to the king and it will be disgust in their eyes. 
And what is correct in my eyes:
Send please in the hand of anywhich 
you can send. Because there is not a person in this world that will not be more appropriate than me for this mission. And the reason for  Moshe's refusal in this is his humbleness. He would have never found it in his heart to rise up and speak to the king and be glorified. It is not in is character to say Hashem sent me and not to take the Jewish people out of Egypt and not to be the king.

Verse 3

God appeared to the Patriarchs as the Prime Mover behind all natural events.  His miracles were apparent to them without recourse to violating the natural order.  In times of famine He redeemed them from death and in war from the sword and provided them with wealth and honor and every good thing.  These things, like all the promises in the Torah of blessing and curse, are not meted out to a man as his due, as a reward for good deeds and punishment for sin.  They constitute miracles (of Divine grace).  Man's own deeds do not automatically give rise to favorable effects or otherwise.  But the reward and punishment alluded to in the Torah in this world are in the nature of miracles, hidden ones which the onlookers regard as the workings of nature.  But in reality they are the providential allocation of reward and punishment.  God said to Moses: I appeared to the Patriarchs as One who assists His chosen ones through the might of my hand (but without violating nature).  By My ineffable name expressing the essence of all existence (Exodus 3:14) I was not known to them to introduce innovations changing the natural course of events.  Therefore tell the Children of Israel that I am the Lord and let them know My great name through which I shall perform for them wonders that they may know that I am the Lord who does these things.

Verse 3

And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart – they said in the Midrash Rabbah (5:6) that [God] revealed to him that [God] would in the future harden [Pharaoh’s] heart so that judgment would be done on him for enslaving them with hard labor. And we read more there (13:4) because I made his heart heavy (Shemot 10:1) – from this verse, said Rabbi Yochanan, the minim say that he had no chance of doing teshuvah. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish answered: ‘let the mouths of the minim be closed, rather He laughs at mockers (Mishlei 3:34), he was warned once, and twice and three times and he did not repent, and He closes the door of teshuvah so to extract [retribution] from him what he sinned. So with the evil Pharaoh, God sent [warnings] to him five times and he did not listen to [God’s] words, God said to him: ‘you stiffened your neck and you made your own heart heavy, behold I am going to add impurity to your impurity.
And here is the answer to the question that everyone asks: If God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, what then was his transgression [since he had no choice]? There are two answers, which both hold true: First, Pharaoh, in his wickedness, had unjustifiably treated the Jews terribly, so he was punished with the withdrawal of the path of repentance, and there are many verses regarding this in the Torah and the Writings, and he was punished by his original deeds. Secondly, only the second half of the [ten] plagues were brought upon Egypt due to Pharaoh’s transgressions, as the Torah states, And Pharaoh’s heart was strengthened, (Shemot 7:13, 26; 8:15), and Pharaoh hardened his heart (ibid. 8:28, 9:7). He did not want to send the Jews out of Egypt for the glory of God; rather, when the plagues increased and he was becoming too worn out to withstand them, his heart softened and he decided to send them out because of the severity of the plagues themselves, but not in order to do the will of his Creator. Therefore, God strengthened his spirit and gave courage to his heart so that His Name would be declared [throughout the world], as we read: Thus will I magnify Myself, and sanctify Myself, and I will make Myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know that I am Adønαi. (Ez. 38:23)
And that that is written before the plagues (Shemot / Ex. 3:19) and I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, this is the reason for and I will stiffen Pharaoh’s heart and multiply My wonders that is to say that I will stiffen his heart so as to increase my wonders in the land of Egypt, because in the last five plagues, and also in the drowning at the sea it is written and Adønαi strenghthened (14:8) because the heart of the king is in the hand of Adønαi He turns it how He wants.

Verse 1



Verse 2

<b>This month shall be unto you the beginning of months</b> is the first commandment which the Holy One Blessed Be He commanded Israel through Moses, and therefore [the previous verse] says "in the land of Egypt," for the remaining commandments of the Torah were [give] at Mount Sinai.  Or it means to say in the land of Egypt, and not in a city of Egypt, as our Sages said (Mekhilta 12:1:4), "outside of a town."<br>It would have been fitting for [the verse] to say first, "Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying," [and then] "This month shall be unto you" and the remainder of the section, but Moses and Aaron stand in place of Israel, and [the verse] says "unto you," referring to all the generations of Israel, and then it returns and says "Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel," that [Moses] should command them in the one-off command of taking the Passover sacrifice of [the generation of] Egypt on the tenth [of the month of Nisan].<br>According to its drash, "unto you" means that sanctification of the month requires a court of expert [judges] (Rosh Hashanah 25b), and therefore it was not written earlier, "Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel," for sanctification of the month applies only to Moses and Aaron and [experts] of their kind.  And the reason for, "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months" is that Israel will count the first month, and from there will count all the months as second and third until the completion of the year with the twelfth month, so that this will be a reminder of a great miracle, for any time that the months will be mentioned the miracle will be remembered, and therefore the months have no names in the Torah, but rather it says, "in the third month" (Exodus 19:1), and, "in the second year in the second month...that the cloud was taken up" (Numbers 10:11), and, "in the seventh month on the first of the month, etc." (Numbers 29:1) and so with all of them [i.e. all verses mentioning dates].<br>And just as the Sabbath Day is remembered by our counting from it the first [day] from the Sabbath and the second [day] from the Sabbath, as I will explain (Ramban on Exodus 20:8:1), so too the Exodus from Egypt is remembered by our counting of the first month and the second and the third from our redemption, for this counting is not for [numbering] the year, for the start of our year is in Tishrei, as it is written (Exodus 34:22), "and the feast of ingathering [i.e.  Sukkot] at the turn of the year," and it is written (Exodus 23:16), "(and the feast of ingathering), at the end of the year."  If so, then when the month of Nisan is called the first [month] and Tishrei the seventh, the solution is that [Nisan is] the first [month] from redemption and [Tishrei is] the seventh.  This is the reason for, "it shall be the first...to you," for it is not the first in the year, but it is the first for you, for such is it called as a remembrance of our redemption.<br>And our Sages have already mentioned this topic, and said that the names of the months came with us from Babylonia (Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah 6a), for at the start we had no names.  The reason for this is that at the start the order of [the months] was as a remembrance of the Exodus from Egypt, but when we left Babylonia and the verse was fulfilled (Jeremiah 16:14-15), "that it shall no more be said: 'As the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt,' but: ‘As the LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north," we returned to calling the months by the names by which they were called in Babylonia, as a reminder that there we stood and from there the Lord drew us out.  For the names Nisan, Iyar, and the others are Persian names and are only found in the books of the Babylonian prophets (Zechariah 1:7, Ezra 6:15, Nehemiah 1:1) and in Megilat Esther (3:7).  Therefore the verse says, "In the first month, which is the month Nisan," similar to, "They cast pur, that is, the lot" (ibid.).  And until today the nations in the lands of Persia and Media call [the months] Nisan and Tishrei and all the rest like us.  And these [names] recall through the months the second redemption just as we did until now for the first one.

Verse 17

Because it is close - And it would be easy to return on that same path to Egypt, and there are many Aggadic Midrashim [about this]. [The above is] the language of Rashi. And it is also the understanding of Rabbi Avraham (a.k.a Ibn Ezra): Because the reason that 'Hashem did not lead them on the path [through] the land of the Philistines' was because 'it was close' and they would regret [leaving] and return to Egypt immediately. But according to my understanding, if it is like their words (Rashi and Ibn Ezra) 'Because Hashem said' would have been first [in the verse], but the verse says "Hashem led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines...for God said: ‘Lest the people regret when they see war, and they return to Egypt.’". But the correct [understanding] is that it is saying "Hashem led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines" which is "close" and [it would be] good to lead them on that path, "because Hashem said, 'Lest the people regret when they see war, and they return to Egypt.'"
And the reason for war was that they would pass through to path of the land of the Philistines and the Philistines would not let them pass in peace, and then they would return to Egypt, but on the path of the wilderness, they would not see war until they were in their land; in the land of Sicon and Og, kings of the Emorites that was given to them, and they would be far from Egypt at that time. And the war with Amalek in Rifidim was not worthwhile to return because of it, because they were that passing through [the Amalekims land] but [rather the Amelekim] came from its land and fought with them because of their hatred for them and if they had conceived of returning to Egypt, it would not have helped because [the Amelekim] would have fought them on the road. And also they were [already] far from Egypt on the crooked path that they went on and they didn't know another way [to return]. And the language of Rashi: When they see war - for example, the wars of the Cananim and the Amelekim, if they had went on a straight path, they would have returned. Just like when [Hashem] led them on a crooked path they said, 'Let us take initiative and return to Egypt', if they had went on a simple [path], all the more so [would they have returned]. [The following is a quote from] Michilta. And the reason it says, "God led them not...But God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness", is when they traveled from Succot, the pillar of cloud began to go before them, and it did not go by the way of the land of the Philistines, but rather went by the way of the wilderness of Eitam and Yisrael went after it. And the cloud rested in Eitam and they camped there, and [Eitam] is on the border of the wilderness. 

Verse 18

And the for [saying] 'And Bnei Yisrael went up armed' - [as if] to say even though Hashem led them around [by] the way of the wilderness, they were scared maybe the Philistines would come upon them, those that lived in the cities close to them, and [therefore] they were armed like those who go to war. And there are those that say [that the reason for the phrase is] that the verse is telling us that they left 'with a raised hand' and they considered themselves redeemed people, and they did not walk like slaves who ran away.

Verse 19



Verse 20



Verse 21

"And Hashem walked before them during the day" - They already said (Bereishit Rabbah 51:2) that "Every place that is says '<i>Va'Hahsem</i>' (lit. and Hashem) [it means] him and his court. The Holy, one blessed is He, was with them during the day and his court [was with them] at night." If so, the verse is explaining that Hashem dwelt in the cloud and He went before them by day in the pillar of cloud, and at night, his court dwelt in the pillar of fire to light [the way] for them, like the reason [behind the verse] (Numbers 14:14) "inasmuch as Thou LORD art seen face to face, and Thy cloud standeth over them, and Thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night". And I saw in <i>Eleh Shemos Rabbah</i> (Shemot Rabbah 19:6) "'For ye shall not go out in haste, Neither shall ye go by flight; For the LORD will go before you' (Isaiah 52:12). [This verse implies] in the past My court and I would get before you, as it says, '<i>Va'Hashem</i> went before them by day' but in the future,  I will go alone [before you], as it says, (Isaiah 52:12) 'For the LORD will go before you, And the God of Israel will be your rearward.'" And the secret [behind] this Midrash is as I have mentioned, because in the first redemption (i.e. the one from Egypt) the Holy one, blessed is He, was with them by day and his court was with them by night. But in the future (lit. the coming future) you will raise [away] the attribute of His court with mercy, and Hashem will walk before them, the singular Hashem, because 'the God of Israel will be your rearward' and 'But the night shineth as the day; The darkness is even as the light.' (Psalms 139:12) because everything [will be dealt] with the unique attribute of mercy. And Rabbi Avraham (a.k.a. Ibn Ezra) says: Because the verse is speaking like the language of people, because the power of Hashem and His messenger [are whom] went with Israel like [the verse] "That caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses" (Isaiah 63:12) . And the truth that it is [actually] like [the verse] '' but not like Rabbi Avraham understood from it, and it says so (i.e. proves my point) "So didst Thou lead Thy people, To make Thyself a glorious name." (Isaiah 63:12)

... And the reason why the verse mentions two forms of listening to God- "to the voice" and "Me," this is because if we listen to the voice of of our God to keep his mitzvot, then His great Name will be a source of healing for us. And this is why the Sages set the blessings on mitzvos to mention that God "made us holy with His mitzvos," because blessings have in them the mention of God's royalty ... And I hereby enlighten your eyes: for each blessing that contains mention of God's royalty is like this, for the Sages gave honor to His Kingship over the world, and that from this Kingship He made us holy and gives us [food and other things to make blessings on]. And the blessings which are close to another blessing, which do not mention Royalty, are in the second person (presence) ... and this is why the prayer "Aleinu" is all in the third person (hidden), because it is said before the Kind of all Kings. Understand this.

..."I am Hashem your God:" This statement is a positive commandment, as it says, "I am Hashem, who teaches and commands you that you should know and believe that there is a Hashem, and He is your God," that is to say, He existed before, from Him came everything by means of his desire [i.e., He created the world because He wanted to, not by accident] and capability, and He is your God, so you are required to serve Him. It says in the text, "who took you out of Eretz Mitzrayim," for He took you out of there to teach you about the reality and the desire [of Hashem], for with His knowledge and providence we left there, and to teach about the newness, for from the beginning of the world, not a thing has changed from His nature, and to teach you about what He can do, which will teach you about His uniqueness, like it says above [in Shmot 9:14], "so that you will know that there is no one like Me in all the land." And this is the reason for [the phrase] "Who took you out" - for they know of and bear witness to all of these [ideas.]
