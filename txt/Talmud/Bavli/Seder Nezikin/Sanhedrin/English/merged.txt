Sanhedrin

Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

Mishnah: Monetary cases with three [judges]. Theft and injury with three. Damages and half damages, double payment and quadruple and quintuple payment with three. 
"Rape, seduction and 'motzi shem ra' (when a husband claims about the virginity of his bride) with three"—the words of Rabbi Meir. 
But the Sages say: 
"Motzi shem ra with twenty-three, because there is in it [an element of] a capital case." 
Lashes with three. 
Because of Rabbi Ishmael, they said
with twenty-three. 
"Intercalation of the month with three. Intercalation of the year with three"—the words of Rabbi Meir. 
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: 
"We begin with three, with five we argue back and forth, and with seven we finish. 
But if you finish with three, then it has been intercalated."   
"'Semichat Zkeinim' (when the elders put their hands on the sacrifice to atone for a sin of the entire people) and the breaking of the calf's neck (when a body is found between jurisdictions) with three"—the words of Rabbi Shimon. 
Rabbi Yehudah says: 
"With five." 
'Chalitzah' (the ceremony of giving up claim to your brother's widow) and 'Miunin' (nullification of a betrothal of a young girl) with three. 
Produce of the fourth year and second tithe whose value is not known with three. 
Things dedicated to the Temple with three. [Payment of a] vow with movable property with three. Rabbi Yehudah says: 
"One of them should be a priest." 
[Payment of a vow with] immovable property with nine and a priest. A person [in payment of a vow] is like these. 
Capital cases with twenty-three. 
Bestiality, either party, with twenty-three, as it is said, "You shall kill the woman and the beast," (Leviticus 20:16), and it says, "the beast, you shall kill it" (Leviticus 20:15). 
Stoned ox with twenty-three, as it is said, "The ox you will stone and also its master will die" (Exodus 21:29)—the death of the ox will be like the death of its master. 
The wolf, lion, bear, tiger, panther and snake—they die with twenty-three. 
Rabbi Eliezer says: 
"Anyone who kills them before is correct." 
But Rabbi Akiva says:
"They die with twenty-three." 
We do not judge a tribe, false prophet, or the High Priest except based on a court of seventy-one, 
and we don't go to a permitted war except based on a court of seventy-one. 
We do not annex a city or region except based on a court of seventy-one. 
We do not make a Sanhedrin for the tribes except based on a court of seventy-one. 
We do not proclaim an idolatrous city except based on a court of seventy-one; 
we do not proclaim an idolatrous city on the border [of the Land of Israel] nor do we proclaim three [idolatrous cities], but we do proclaim one or two.
 The Great Sanhedrin was with seventy-one, and the smaller twenty-three. 
How do we know that the greater had seventy-one? As it is said, "Gather for me seventy people from the elders of Israel" (Numbers 11:16), and Moses in addition to them. 
Rabbi Yehudah says: 
"Seventy." 
And how do we know that the smaller had twenty-three? As it is said, "You will judge the congregation and save the congregation" (Numbers 35:24)—a 'congregation' judges and a 'congregation' saves, thus it is twenty. 
And how do we know a 'congregation' is ten? As it is said, "How long for this evil congregation? Then came out Joshua and Caleb" (Numbers 14:27) [i.e. there were ten evil spies remaining]. 
And where do we know to add the three? We learn, as it is said, "Don't go after the majority to convict" (Exodus 23:2). Should I learn that I should be with them for acquittal? If so, why does it say, "after the majority [do not] incline" (Exodus 23:2)? 
Your inclining to acquittal is not like your inclining to conviction. By one vote shall you incline to acquittal, and by two votes

Daf 2b

and we don't have an even court, so we add another one on those [twenty-two]—thus there are twenty-three. 
And how many people should there be in a city in order to have a Sanhedrin? One-hundred and twenty. Rabbi Nechemiah said: 
"Two-hundred and thirty, so that they correspond to the rulers of ten [of the Israelites in the wilderness]. 
Gemara: But are thefts and injuries not [in the category] of monetary cases?
Rabbi Abahu said:
"[The Mishnah] teaches an exhaustive list.
What are monetary cases? Thefts and injuries, but confessions and loans are not." 
And [this language] is necessary: 
for, if it had taught [only] "monetary cases", than I would have thought that it included confessions and loans—thus, it teaches "thefts and injuries";...
but if it had taught "thefts and injuries" and not taught "monetary cases", I would have thought 
that this was the law even for confessions and loans and the reason for it teaching "thefts and injuries" was because the essential [common factor] is three [judges], since it is written about both thefts and injuries—
thefts, as it is written, "The owner of the house will approach the judges" (Exodus 22:7); injuries: what difference is an 'injury' in his body or his property?[and I would assume confessions and loans followed the same law]—
thus it teaches: 
"What are monetary cases? Thefts and injuries, but confessions and loans are not." ...
But what [is the difference between thefts and injuries and confessions and loans]?
If we say that [confessions and loans] do not require three [judges], did not Rabbi Abahu say that, "Two that judge monetary cases, their judgement does not stand?" Rather, [the difference is] that [confessions and loans] do not require experts. 
What is [the Mishnah's] explanation [for this]? 
If it holds that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here (a principle connecting one passage in Exodus 23 to another in order to require three judges for monetary cases), then it would require experts [here] also. And if it doesn't hold that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here, why does it [require] three [at all]? 
[The Mishnah] always holds that 'eruv parashiyot' applies here and that the law should be that we require also experts [in confessions and loans]. But the reason that we do not require experts is because of Rabbi Chanina, 
as Rabbi Chanina said: 
"According to the Torah, monetary and capital cases are the same when it comes to cross-examination [of the witnesses]

Daf 3a

as it says, "There will be one law for you" (Leviticus 24:22). 
So what's the reason they said that monetary cases do not require cross-examination? In order to not lock the door before the borrowers [i.e. to make borrowing very difficult]."
[So too, here, we relax the requirement for experts in confessions and loans in order to not lock the door before the borrowers].—Following this [reasoning], if [the judge] errs, he should not [have to pay for his mistake]!
All the more so [would this] be locking the door before the borrowers.
If so, [the Mishnah] teaches two things:
"Monetary cases with three laypeople, thefts and injuries with three experts."
And further,
why does it say "three" twice?
Rather, Rava said:
"It teaches two things because of Rabbi Chanina."
Rav Acha son of Rav Ika said:
"From the Torah, one [judge] would also be fitting, as it is said, 'With justice shall you judge your people' (Leviticus 19:15)."—But is it because of the problem of tramps at street corners [judging confessions and loans that we require] ...
three? [No, for] how could it be with [three] tramps at street corners ...
that one of them wasn't learned? 
Following from this [reasoning], if they err [perhaps] they shouldn't [have to] pay? ...
All the more so would this increase [the problem of] tramps at street corners [judging confessions and loans]
—What is the difference between [the positions of] Rava and Rav Acha son of Rav Ika?
This is the difference: as Shmuel said,
"Two [judges] that judge a case, their judgements stand but they are called a rebellious court"
—Rava holds according to Shmuel, Rav Acha son of Rav Ika does not hold according to Shmuel.
Mishnah: Damages and half damages etc.
Is "damages" [the same as] "injuries"?
Since it needed to teach "half-damages", it also taught "full damages". 
But is "half-damages" also [the same as] "injuries"? 
It is taught "money", and it taught "fine" [i.e. the Mishnah teaches that half-damages are fines, not ordinary monetary cases]. 
This is fine for the person who said that 
half-damages is a fine, but for the one who said that half-damages is money, what is there for him to say? 
Rather, 
since it needed to teach double payments and quadruple and quintuple payments are money.

Daf 3b

for which one does not pay the principle [value of the object], it taught that half-damages is also money for which one does not pay the principle. And since it had to teach half-damages, it taught also damages.
Three [judges]—where [do we know this] from?! 
As our rabbis taught:
"'The owner will come before the judges [HaElohim, lit. God]" (Exodus 22:7)—this is one. "The matter of both [litigants] shall come before the judges [HaElohim]" (Exodus 22:8)—this is two. "Which the judges [HaElohim] shall declare guilty" (Exodus 22:8)—this is three."—the words of Rabbi Yoshayah. 
Rabbi Yonatan says: 
'The first was stated as a first instance and we don't expound from first instances [i.e. we can't use the first appearance of a word in our explanation]. Instead, 
"The matter of both [litigants] shall come before the judges [HaElohim]" (Exodus 22:8)—this is one. "Which the judges [HaElohim] shall declare guilty" (Exodus 22:8)—this is two. There are no even-numbered courts so we add upon them another one—this is three.'" 
Let us say that it is about [this principle] of not expounding from first instances that they disagree, 
that one master thinks 
we do expound from first instances and the other master thinks 
we do not expound from first instances. 
No! According to everyone we don't expound from first instances. 
Rabbi Yoshayah would say to you: 
"If so, the verse should state 'the owner shall come to the judge [hashofet]'! Why 'to God [HaElohim]'?" We learn from this that [this word] is in the counting. 
And Rabbi Yonatan [would say to you]: 
"It is using normal language—as people say—
for a person who has a case to bring to the judge." 
But does Rabbi Yoshayah not hold by [the principle] of [not having] an odd-numbered court? 
Is it not taught: 
"Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yose HaGlili said:
'What does the verse teach, "After the majority you should incline" (Exodus 23:2)? "To incline"—the Torah says, 
"Make for yourself an odd-numbered court" [lit. an inclined court]'"?! 
He thinks according to Rabbi Yehudah, who says 
"seventy", 
as it is taught: 
"The Great Sanhedrin had seventy-one. But Rabbi Yehudah says: 'Seventy'." Let's say that you learn this for Rabbi Yehudah concerning the Great Sanhedrin as the verses are written; with all other courts, could you learn this for him? 
Or you could say there's no difference [between the Great Sanhedrin and other courts], for is it not taught: 
"'The laying of the hands of the elders and the ceremony of the breaking of the calf's neck with three [judges]'—the words of Rabbi Shimon. 
And Rabbi Yehudah says: 
'With five'"
—and we say 
what the reasoning is for Rabbi Yehudah: "'They will lay their hands'—this is two; 'elders'—this is two (Leviticus 4:15)—and there is no even-numbered court, so we add upon them another one—this is five."!? 
Rabbi Yoshayah['s opinion] seems more forceful than Rabbi Yehudah's, because if with the Great Sanhedrin Rabbi Yehudah does not have [the requirement of having an odd-numbered court] then in all other courts he does; but Rabbi Yoshayah, in all other courts he does not also. 
However, what does [Rabbi Yoshayah] do [with the word] "to incline"? 
He assigns it to capital cases 
but not to monetary cases. 
But it is taught [in the Mishnah]: 
"Two [judges] that say he is acquitted, one that says he is liable, he is acquitted; 
two that say he is liable, one that says he is acquitted, he is liable"! [I.e. it assumes majority rule in monetary cases]. 
Can we say that this [Mishnah] is not in accordance with Rabbi Yoshayah? 
No! It can even be said from Rabbi Yoshayah['s view]. He would derive it from a kal vahomer (a principle deriving the law for a more lenient case from a more stringent case) from capital cases. 
Since capital cases are so stringent and God says, ...
"Go after the majority", all the more so in monetary cases.
Our rabbis taught: 
"Monetary cases with three [judges]; Rabbi said:
'With five, so that the case will be completed with three [i.e. the ruling will come from at least three judges].'"
But if we have three, can the case not be completed with two? 
This is what [Rabbi] meant: 
"Because the case is completed with three." 
Therefore,
when the Torah says three, it is written concerning the case's completion. 
Rabbi Abahu ridiculed this: 
"From this [reasoning], the Great Sanhedrin would need one-hundred and forty-one in order to complete the case with seventy-one! And the lesser Sanhedrin would need forty-five in order to complete the case with twenty-three! 
Rather, 
'Gather me seventy people' (Numbers 11:16); God says, from the time of gathering [there should be] seventy. 
'Judge the congregation; save the congregation' (Numbers 35:24) is also from the time of judging the congregation. 
So too, 'The owner shall approach the judges' (Exodus 22:7) is from the time of approach.
 Rather, this is the reasoning of Rabbi: 
'That the judges [HaElohim, in the plural] declare guilty' (Exodus 22:8)—two. Judges [Elohim] is said below and is said above; just as below [it indicates] two, so too above [it indicates] two, and there is no even-numbered court, [so we] add upon them an additional one—this is five."

Daf 4a

and the Sages [who say three judges come to this conclusion because] it is written "he will make them guilty" [instead of "they will make them guilty" as it is read—thus there is one above, one below, and then add another because there are no even-numbered courts—this is three].
Rabbi Yitzhak son of [Yose] said that Rabbi Yohanan said:
"Rabbi, Rabbi Yehudah son of Ro'etz, Bet Shammai, Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Akiva all think
that the way the Torah is read takes precedence [over the way in which it is written when deriving law from biblical passages]."
Rabbi, as we already said.
Rabbi Yehudah son of Ro'etz, as it is taught [in a baraita]:
"His students asked Rabbi Yehudah son of Ro'etz,
'I read "two weeks [shvu'ayim]" (Leviticus 12:5) [for the period of impurity after a female child is born]. But perhaps the birth of a female [child] should cause impurity for seventy [shiv'im] [days]?'
He said to them,
'There is impurity and purity for a male, and there is impurity and purity for a female.
Just as the [period of] purity for a female is double that for a male [in length], so too is the [period of] impurity for a female is double that for a male.'
After they left, he left and followed after them.
He said to them,
'You don't need to rely on what I said! We read "two weeks [shvu'ayim]" and the way the Torah is read takes precedence.'"
Beit Shammai, as it is taught [in a Mishnah]:
"Beit Shammai say:
'For all that is offered on the outer altar, given as an offering, one [sprinkling of the sacrifice's blood on the corner of the altar], then it atones (as it is said, "The blood of your sacrifice you should pour" (Deuteronomy 12:27));
but for a sin offering, two [sprinklings are required].'
And Beit Hillel say:
'Even for the sin offering that is given as an offering, one [sprinkling atones].'"
And Rav Huna said:
"What the reason of Beit Shammai? [We read] 'kranot', 'kranot', 'kranot', (corners, each plural) (Leviticus 4:7)—this is six [sprinklings]: four ideally, but two suffice;
but Beit Hillel say:
[it is written] 'kranot', 'karnat', 'karnat' (one plural, two singular)—this is four [sprinklings]: three ideally, and one suffices."
But let us say [according to Beit Hillel] that all [of the sprinklings] are for the ideal [case]? [No!] We don't find that [one can get] atonement with zero [sprinklings].
Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught [in a baraita]:
"Two [walls for the Sukkah] according to their law, and a third [that can be as small as] even a hand-breadth.
Rabbi Shimon says:
'Three according to their law, and a fourth [that can be as small as] even a hand-breadth.'"
What are they disagreeing about?
The Sages think
that the way the Torah is written takes precedence, and Rabbi Shimon thinks
that the way the Torah is read takes precedence.
The Sages think
that the way the Torah is written takes precedence, "besukkat", "besukkat", "besukkot" (two singular, one plural)—thus there are four.
Lose one verse for [the law] itself (see sugya above on 3b), three remain to come for the law; reduce the third and assign it to a handbreadth;
while Rabbi Shimon thinks
"besukkot", "besukkot", "besukkot" (all plural)—thus there are six. Lose one verse for [the law] itself, six remain to come for the law; reduce the fourth and assign it to a handbreadth.
Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught [in a baraita]:
"Rabbi Akiva said:
'From where [do we know] that a revi'it (volume measure) that leaves from two corpses will make the tent impure? "On all dead 'nefashot' (plural) do not approach" (Leviticus 21:11); two nefashot and one measure.'"
And the Sages:
"Nafshat" (singular) it is written.
Rav Aha bar Yaakov attacked this:
"Is there anyone who doesn't hold that the way the text is pronounced takes precedence?
Is it not taught [in a baraita]: "'In its mother's milk (halav)' (Exodus 23:19). Could it be in fat (heilev)"?!

Daf 4b

You [i.e., the baraita, should] say:
The way the text is pronounced takes precedence!
Thus
according to everyone the way the way the text is pronounced takes precedence.
And Rabbi and the Sages disagree on this:
Rabbi thinks:
"Yarshi'un" (Exodus 22:8) is another [set of] judges (Elohim) [from the first set: thus there are five]; and the Sages think:
"Yarshi'un" is this and that [i.e. Elohim before and Elohim here are obviously referring to the same Elohim—thus three judges].
Rabbi Yehudah ben Ro'eitz—the Sages did not disagree about it.
Beit Hillel, as it is taught [in a baraita]:
"And he atones" (Leviticus 4:20), "And he atones" (Leviticus 4:26), "And he atones" (Leviticus 4:31)—because of the analogy [you might have drawn proving that four sprinkles are required].
But is this not [derived from] an analogy?
It is said "blood" below and it is said "blood" above:
just as "blood" that was said below, since it is given as an offering, one [sprinkling] atones—so too "blood" that was said above, since it is given as an offering, one sprinkling atones.
Or you could derive it in this way:
It is said "blood" for the outside [altar] and it is said "blood" for the inside [altar];
just as "blood" that was said for the inside, if it's missing from from its offerings it does nothing at all, so too "blood" that was said for the outside, if it's missing from its offerings, it does nothing at all!?
Let us compare what is similar:
We decide outside from outside and we do not decide outside from inside.
Or you could derive it in this way:
We compare a sin offering [with a sprinkling on all] four corners from a [different] sin offering [with a sprinkling on all] four corners,
and this would not be proved from any sin offering that does not have [a sprinkling on all] four corners!
Learn to say:
"And he atones," "And he atones," "And he atones"—because of the analogy [you might have otherwise drawn].
He atones even if he only did three [sprinklings], he atones even if he only did two, he atones even if he only did one.
And Rabbi Shimon and the Sages disagree on this:
Rabbi Shimon thinks
the skhakh doesn't require a verse; and the Sages think
the skhakh does require a verse.
And Rabbi Akiva and the Sages disagree on this: Rabbi Akiva thinks
"Nefashot" (Leviticus 21:11)—learn two [i.e. nefashot appears twice, so learn his principle from the fact that it appears twice]; and the Sages think
"Nefashot"—learn it is ordinary [i.e. it's just a normal way to use the same word twice in this instance].
And according to everyone, the way Scripture is pronounced takes precedence?!
But is it not taught [in a baraita]:
"Letotafat" (Exodus 13:16), "Letotafat" (Deuteronomy 6:8), "Letotafot" (Deuteronomy 11:18) [i.e. in the singular twice and in the plural once], thus there are four [chambers in the tefillin]—the words of Rabbi Yishmael.
Rabbi Akiva says:
It is not necessary! "Tat" in Coptic is two, "pat" in African is two [thus totafat shows there are four chambers]?
Rather, they always disagree, and these matters where they disagree are cases where the pronunciation is different from the traditional [text]; however, this "halav" and "heilev" are when [the word could be] both [then] the way Scripture is pronounced takes precedence.
For behold, "Yir'eh" "Yera'eh" (Exodus 23:17) [one in active, one in causitive] are where they are both the same and they disagree!
As it is taught [in a baraita]: Yohanan ben Dehavai says in the name of Rabbi Yehudah ben Teima:
"One who is blind in one of his eyes is exempt from pilgrimage [hera'ah], as it is said: 'Yir'eh'. 'Yir'eh': like the way that he comes to see, so too he comes to see; just as one sees with two eyes, so too he has to be seen with two eyes."
Rather, Rav Aha son of Rav Ika said:
"The verse said: 'Do not cook a kid' (Exodus 23:19)—it is the way of boiling that the Torah forbade [and thus the only way to read the verse is with halav and not heilev].
Our rabbis taught:
"Monetary cases, with three [judges].

Daf 5a

But if he was an expert for the many, he [can] judge even alone."
Rav Nahman said:
"Just like I judge monetary cases by myself." 
And so said Rabbi Hiyya:
"Just like I judge monetary cases by myself."
It was asked:
"Just like I, who have learned, explained, and received permission."
But if he didn't receive permission, his judgement is not law,
or maybe
even though he didn't receive permission, hie judgement is law?
Come learn:
That Mar Zutra son of Rav Nahman judged a case and erred. He came before Rav Yosef. He said to him:
"If they [the litigants] received you upon themselves [i.e. agreed to you judging alone], you don't pay; but if not, go and pay."
Learn from this:
When he didn't receive permission, his judgement is law—learn from this.
Rav said:
"Anyone who wants to judge a case and if he errs wants to be exempt [from payment], [should] take permission from the Exilarchate."
And so said Shmuel:
"[He should] take permission from the Exilarchate."
It's obvious from here to here [Babylon] and from there to there [Eretz Yisrael] ([permission] is effective), and from here to there (is also) effective since here is "staff" and there is "lawgiver",
as it is taught [in a baraita]:
"'The staff will never leave from Judah' (Genesis 49:10)—these are the Exilarchs in Babylon that rule Israel [i.e. Jews] with the staff;
'And the lawgiver from between his legs' (Genesis 49:10)—these are the descendants of Hillel that teach Torah in public."
[But] from there to here, what['s the law]?
Come learn:
That Rabbah bar Hanah judged a case and erred. He came before Rabbi Hiyya.
He said to him:
"If they [the litigants] received you upon themselves [i.e. agreed to you judging alone], you don't pay; but if not, go and pay."
But Rabbah bar Hanah received permission!
Learn from this:
From there to here it is not effective. Learn from this.
And it's not effective?
But Rabbah bar Rav Huna argued against the Exilarchate, saying:
"It was not from you that I received permission! I received permission from my father, my master, and my father, my master from Rav, and Rav from Rabbi Hiyya, and Rabbi Hiyya from Rabbi!"
It was mere speech that he was throwing at them.
But if [permission] wasn't effective, why did Rabbah bar Hanah get permission?
For the towns that are by the borders.

Daf 5b



Daf 6a


when 2 people judge a court case, everyone agrees that their verdict is not valid


When two people judge a monetary case, everyone agrees that their verdict is not valid

Daf 6b
























Rebby had the following challenge:
-It shouldn't say "to the whole nation"
it should just have said 'to the poor people that came to him'
rather (Rebby says)
even in the cases where Dovid didn't pay for the loser, it was still justice for one person and charity for the other person-

R'Shmion Ben Minasey says:
-Two people who come in front of you for court, until you hear their case, or from the time you heard their claims, and you don't know what the verdict should be, you can still advise them
to make a compromise.
From the time you heard their claims, and you know what the verdict should be, you are not allowed to tell them
to compromise.
As it says in the Torah - "......."  (He now elaborates on this Posuk) Before the case has been unraveled, you may steer them toward peace.  But from the time when the case has been unraveled, you can't steer them toward peace

-If two people came into court, and one is soft and one is tough, until you (the judge) heard what they said, and you don't know what the verdict should be, you are allowed to say to them 
'I don't want to deal with this case"
because perhaps you will declare the tough guy guilty, and he will come after you.
But once you have heard their claims, you can't excuse yourself from the case.  As the Torah says (beginning of Devarim) "Do not be afraid of anyone"-
R'Yehosua Ben Karcha says:
-From where do we know that a student who sits and watches his Rabbi (when his Rabbi is judging), and he (the student) sees that the poor person should be innocent and the rich person should be obligated, so from where do we know that he should not be quiet?  As it says in the Torah "Do not be afraid of anyone"-       Rebby Channin says:
-The posuk means don't hide your words because of anyone-
The witnesses should know who they are testifying about, who they are testifying in front of (Hashem), and who will hold them accountable (Hashem).  As the Torah says "The people standing in a court case are standing in front of Hashem."
The judges should also know who they are judging, who they are judging in front of, and who will hold them accountable.  As the Torah says "Judges stand in the presence of G-D."
And similarly in Yehoshafat it says "He said to the judges 'See what you are doing, for you are not judging for man, you are judging for Hashem.'"  What if the judge says "What do I need all this for?"  Say to him that Hashem is with him.  Also, a judge is only accountable for what his eye sees.
How would we define 'Gemar Din'?
Rav Yehuda says that Rav says
.-'This person is innocent and this person is guilty'-
Rav Says
-The Halacha follows R' Yehoshua Ben Karcha

Wasnt' Rav Huna a student of Rav?  When people would come to Rav Huna he would ask them 
if they want strict justice or compromise.-
Reb Yehoshua Ben Karcha responds to this by saying that it is a Mitzvah to ask the litigants if they want strict justice or compromise

where does the Torah reference false witnesses?
reference to false witnesses
but it is written "as they have testified falsely"?
rather
where is the Biblical reference that false witnesses are lashed? because it says "and they merit the righteous and indited the wicked"
because "they have merited the righteous and indited the wicked" - then, if the wicked should be lashed
rather
witnesses that testified against the righteous and then came other witnesses and testified against the righteous

Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav:
Any city which does not contain two to speak and one to listen, we do not seat a Sanhedrin-court.
And in Beitar, there were three, and in Yavne, four.


































And it was taught:
Any city that does not have in it these ten things, it is not appropriate for a Sage to live within it.
A court that [punishes] with lashes and punishes [with penalties], a charity fund, collected by two and distributed by three, a synagogue, a bathhouse, a restroom, a doctor [for circumcision], a bookkeeper, a notary [for writing scrolls], a butcher, and a teacher of children. 
In the name of Rabbi Akiva, they said, even types of fruit because there are types of fruit that help eyesight.

Therefore a singular man was created-- to teach you that anyone who causes one Israelite life to be lost, the text accounts to him as if he caused a whole world to be lost.  And anyone who sustains one Israelite life, the text accounts to him as if he sustained an entire world.
And for the sake of peace among the creations--so that no man can say to his friend, "My father is greater than your father."  And so that heretics will not claim
"There are multiple powers in the heavens."
And to testify to the greatness of the Holy Blessed One.  For a man forges many coins from the same mold and each one is identical.  But the King of kings of kings, the Holy Blessed One forges each man from the same mold of the original man and no one is like his fellow.
Therefore each and ever person is obligated to say,
"For me was the world created."

We learn in a Braitta
The verse could have said, "Men."  So what is the Torah teaching us by saying "Any man?"  It's to include worshipers of stars, that they can't curse Hashem's name either.
We cannot execute the worshipers of stars except by the sword because all executions of the sons of Noah are done by the sword.
Is this really where we learn that they cannot curse Hashem?
Don't we learn it from here?:
"Hashem" - this is teaching that they cannot curse Hashem.
Rabbi Yitzchak Nephacha says
We need the verse that says "Any man" to teach us that they can't curse names of Hashem besides Y-H-W-H



















Our Rabbis Taught: 
The Children of Noah were commanded regarding seven mitzvot:
(1) Justice, (2) Blasphemy, (3) Idol Worship, (4) Major Sexual Violations (5) Murder, (6) Robbery (7) Eating the limb of a living animal.

Daf 56b

Rabbi Chaninah ben (Gamla) said:
Also regarding [eating] the blood of a living animal.
Rabbi Chidka said:
Also regarding castration.
Rabbi Shimon said:
Also regarding sorcery.
Rabbi Yossi said:
All that is said in the [Biblical] passage of sorcery, a Noahide is enjoined about —
(Deuteronomy 18:10-12) "There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, a soothsayer, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or one that consulteth a ghost or a familiar spirit, or a necromancer... and because of these abominations the LORD thy God is driving them out from before thee." — and they could not be punished unless they had been enjoined.
Rabbi Elazar said:
Also regarding <i>kilayim</i> [hybridization].
Noahides are permitted to wear <i>kilayim</i> [i.e. mixed wool and linen], and to plant <i>kilayim</i> [i.e. specific combinations of plants], and are only forbidden from breeding [mixed species of] domesticated animal and grafting trees.
How do we know this?
Rabbi Yochanan said:
The Torah says, (Genesis 2:16) "And the Lord God commanded the man saying, 'You may certainly eat of every tree of the garden.'"
"And he commanded" means establishing justice. For it says (Genesis 18:19): "For I know concerning him that he will command his children after him."
"Hashem" that is a reference to the prohibition against blasphemy. As it says (Leviticus 24:16), "Anyone who curses the name of the Lord shall be certainly killed."
"God" is a reference to idol worship as it says (Exodus 20:2), "There shall not be for you any other gods."
"Upon Man" this is the prohibition against bloodshed. And so it says (Genesis 9:6), "One who spills human blood etc...."
"Saying" this is a reference to sexual transgressions. As it says (Jeremiah 3:1) "Saying, a man sends away his wife and she goes to live with another man."
"From any tree in the garden" - but not something stolen. "You shall eat" but don't eat a limb from a living animal.
When Rabbi Yitzchak came, he taught it differently.
"And he commanded" is a reference to idol worship. "Elohim" is a reference to establishing justice. 
I understand why he thinks the word "Elohim" is a reference to justice since the Torah says (Exodus 22:7), and the litigants shall approach the judges (Elohim).
But, "and he commanded" why does that suggest the prohibition against idol worship?
Rav Chisda and Rav Yitzchak bar Avidimi answered that question.
One said:
(Exodus 32:8) "They have quickly turned from the path that they have been commanded to follow and have made themselves [a golden calf]."
The other one said: (Hosea 5:11), "Ephraim is defrauded, robbed of justice, because he has witlessly gone after futility."
What is the difference? Here is the difference: Someone non-Jewish who made an idol and didn't worship it.
The one says "they have made" thinks the problem is the moment when the idol is made. The one who says, "he has witlessly gone after" the prohibition does not start until he goes and worships the idol.
























A baraita teaches: Just as Israel was commanded to establish courts in every single town and every single city. So too the Children of Noah are commanded to establish courts in every single town and every single city.


The school of Menace taught:
There are seven mitzvot that were commanded to the Children of Noah:
(1)Idol worship, (2) Sexual transgressions, (3) Bloodshed, (4) Theft, (5) Eating the limb of an living animal, (6) castration, (7) mixing two species together.
Rabbi Yehudah says:
The first man was commanded only against idol worship, as it says, "and the Lord God commanded the man."
Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:
He was also commanded against blasphemy
and also to establish courts.

WHEN DOES HE BECOME LIABLE TO THE PENALTY OF A STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS SON’? FROM THE TIME THAT HE PRODUCES TWO HAIRS UNTIL HE GROWS A BEARD RIGHT ROUND (BY WHICH IS MEANT THE HAIR OF THE GENITALS, NOT THAT OF THE FACE, BUT THAT THE SAGES SPOKE IN POLITE TERMS),
FOR IT IS WRITTEN, IF A MAN HAVE A STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS SON (Deuteronomy 21:18): ‘A SON’, BUT NOT A DAUGHTER;‘A SON’, BUT NOT A FULL-GROWN MAN. 
WHILST A MINOR IS EXEMPT, SINCE HE DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE COMMANDMENTS....
[Shealah] Whence do we know that A MINOR IS EXEMPT?
[Teshuva] Whence do we know? 
The Mishnah states the reason, viz that 
HE DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE COMMANDMENTS.
[Another Teshuva with a rhetorical question] Moreover, ...
where else do we find that Scripture prescribed a penalty [for a minor], that a verse should be necessary here to exempt him? This is our question:
4. [Clarification of the shealah] Thus we say: 
Now, is then a ‘STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS SON’ executed ...
for his actual iniquity? Surely he is rather slain on account of his ultimate end; and that being so, even a minor should be executed? Moreover, [the interpretation,]
5. [Another justification of the shealah] ‘a son’, but not a man, implies a minor? Rab Judah said in Rab’s name:
6. [Teshuva] Scripture says, If a man has a son [that is stubborn and rebellious], implying, a son near to the strength of manhood.

Our Rabbis taught: "[If a thief be found breaking in, and is beaten and dies], there shall be no bloodguilt, if daylight shines on him (Shemot 22:1-2)." Does the sun shine on him alone? Rather, the verse is to be understood metaphorically: if the matter is as clear to you as the sun that he has not come in peace, but rather intends to kill you, then you may kill him, but if not, do not kill him. 

Daf 72b












































'See, he is an Israelite, and a son of the covenant, whilst the Torah hath said, Whosoever would shed the blood of a man, [to save] that man shall his own blood be shed,19  meaning, save the blood of the pursued by the blood of the pursuer'!

Daf 73a

Mishna: And these are the ones whom we save [at the expense] of their lives:
One who chases after his friend to kill him, or after a male, or after a betrothed young woman.
But one who chases after an animal, one who violates the Sabbath, and one who serves star-worship - we do not save [at the expense] of their lives.

It has been taught:  R. Jose said; Originally there were not many disputes in Israel, but one Beit Din of seventy-one members sat in the Hall of Hewn Stones, and two courts of twenty-three sat, one at the entrance of the Temple Mount and one at the door of the Court, and other courts of twenty-three sat in all Jewish cities.  If a matter of inquiry arose, the local Beit Din was consulted.  If they had a tradition they stated it; if not, they went to the nearest Beth Din.  If they had a tradition, they stated it; if not, they went to the one situated at the entrance of the Court, and he declared, “Thus I have expounded, and thus have my colleagues expounded; thus have I taught and thus have they taught.”  If they had a tradition, they stated it, and if not, they all proceeded to the Hall of Hewn Stones, where they (Sanhedrin) sat from the morning tamid, until the evening tamid.  On Shabbat and festivals they sat within the hel.  The question was then put before them; if they had a tradition they stated it; if not, they took a vote: if the majority voted “unclean” they declared it so; if “clean” they ruled so.  But when the disciples of Shammai and Hillel, who had insufficiently studied, increased in number, disputes multiplied in Israel, and the Torah became as two Torot.

At what point is the soul given to a human? Is it from the moment of decree [that such a child will exist], or from the moment of formation?
He responded:
"from the moment of formation." 
He replied,
 "is it possible that a piece of meat can last for three days without salt, and yet not become rotten?
 Rather it must be from the moment of decree."  
Rebbe said:

And Rabbi Eliezer was quiet.
And Rabbi Abba said:
You do not have a more obvious end [of days] than this, as it is said (Ezekiel 36, 8): "But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to My people Israel; [for they are at hand to come.]".

Rab Judah said in Rab's name:
One should never [intentionally] bring himself to the test, since David king of Israel did so, and fell. 










































































Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav,
David was afflicted with leprosy for six months, and the divine presence departed from him, and the sanhedrin separated from him.
He was afflicted with leprosy, as it says, "Purge me with hyssop till I am pure; wash me till I am whiter than snow." (Psalms 51:9) The divine presence departed from him, as it says, "Let me again rejoice in Your help; let a vigorous spirit sustain me." (Psalms 51:14) And the sanhedrin separated from him, as it says, "May those who fear You, those who know Your decrees, turn again to me." (Psalms 119:79)
...From where do we learn six months? As it says, "The length of David’s reign over Israel was forty years." (I Kings 2:11)

Daf 107b

David reigned for seven years in Hebron, and in Jerusalem he reigned for 33 years. And it states, "In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months ..." (2 Samuel 5:5) Those six months were not counted, learn from this that he was afflicted with leprosy.
He said before him, 
"Master of the universe, forgive me of this sin."
He forgave him.
"Show me a sign of Your favor, that my enemies may see and be frustrated because You, O Lord, have given me aid and comfort." (Psalms 87:17) He replied,
"In your lifetime I will not make it known, but I will make it known in the lifetime of your son Solomon."
When Solomon built the temple, he wanted to bring the ark into the holy of holies, but the gates stuck to one another.
He said twenty four psalms but was not answered.
He said, "O gates, lift up your heads! Up high, you everlasting doors, so the King of glory may come in! Who is the King of glory?— the Lord, mighty and valiant, the Lord, valiant in battle." (Psalms 24:7-8) And it says, "O gates, lift up your heads! Lift them up, you everlasting doors, so the King of glory may come in!" (Psalms 24:9) and he was not answered. Once he said, "O Lord God, do not reject Your anointed one; remember the loyalty of Your servant David.” (2 Chronicles 6:42), he was immediately answered
At that exact moment, the faces of David's enemies turned black like a pot, and all of Israel knew that the Holy One had forgiven him of his sin.

Rabbi Yochanan said

Daf 108a



















































These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations. R. Johanan said: 
In his generations, but not in other generations.  Resh Lakish maintained: 
[Even] in his generations — how much more so in other generations.  
R. Hanina said: As an illustration of R. Johanan's view, to what may this be compared? To a barrel of wine lying in a vault of vinegar: in its place, its odour is fragrant [by comparison with the vinegar]; elsewhere, its odour would not be fragrant.  
R. Oshaia said: 
As an illustration of Resh Lakish's view, to what may this be compared? To a phial of spikenard oil lying amidst refuse: [if] it is fragrant where it is, how much more so amidst spices!

"I appeared unto Abraham": Said the Holy One blessed be He to Moses: Alas for those who are gone, never to be replaced (in reference to the Patriarchs)!  Many times I revealed myself to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as God Almighty (El Shadai), but I did not make known to them that My name is the lord as I have told thee and they did not question my ways.  I said to Abraham: (Gen 13) "Arise and go forth in the land the length and breadth...for to thee shall I give it" - He sought to bury Sarah and did not find where, until he purchased a place with money - yet he did not question my ways."  I said to Isaac (Gen 26): "Dwell in this land...for to thee and thy seed shall I give all these lands" - He sought to drink water and did not find, "And the shepherds of Gerar strove with the shepherds of Isaac" - yet he did not question my ways.  I said unto Jacob (Gen 29): "The land which thouh liest on, to thee will I give it and unto thy seed" - He sought a place to pitch his tent and did not find until he acquired it for a hundred kesitah - yet he did not question my ways, and did not ask Me what was My name as you have asked.  Yet you at the beginning of My mission did say to Me, "What is His name?"  And at the end you  did say (Exodus 5:23): "Since I came to speak in Your name, he has done evil to this people." (Genesis Rabbah 6:4)
