            "\"Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad... and these are the names of his daughters...\" (Numbers 27:1) - Why are they first called \"the daughters of Zelophehad\" and after by their names? Read the name Zelophehad (צלפחד) as Zel (צל) and Ophechad (ופחד) meaning 'shadow' (צל) 'and fear' (ופחד).  In the beginning, they were in the shadow of their father and feared becoming married lest they lose their ancestral portion, but from when the sisters took agency for themselves, they became known by their own names, as it is written, \"Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad... and these are the names...\" (Numbers 27:1) "
