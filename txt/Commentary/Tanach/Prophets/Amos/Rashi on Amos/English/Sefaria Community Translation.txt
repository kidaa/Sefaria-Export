Rashi on Amos

Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>Who was in (the) Nokdim: </b> And Targum Yonatan translates it as: "Master of Sheep", just as Mesha, the King of Moab, was a "Noked" (Melachim 2, 3).
<b> Two years before the earthquake: </b> Two years before King Uzziah died, on the day that Isaiah (Isaiah 6) prophesied "And the foundations shall be shaken." It is referenced by Zechariah (Zechariah 14) when he says "Just as you had fled from the earthquake."
