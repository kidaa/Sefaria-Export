...And to Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go to Anathoth to your own fields, for you (are) deservant of death, but on this day I will not put you to death, because you did bear the ark of the Lord God before David, my father, and because you were afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.

And Elijah, the Tishibite, from the dwellers of Gilad, said to Ahab, "As the Lord, God of Israel, lives, before whom I stood, there will not be rain or dew except according to my word."  There was a word of God to him, saying: "Go from this, and turn yourself eastward, and hide yourself by the Brook of Crit that is on the banks of the Jordan.  
And there will be from the brook for you to drink, and I commanded the ravens to sustain you there.And he went and did according to the word of the Lord, and he went and dwelled by the brook of Crit, on the banks of the Jordan.  And the ravens were bringing to him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening.  And from the brook he drank.
And so it happened that it was the end of the year, and the brook had dried up, for there was not any rain in the land.
