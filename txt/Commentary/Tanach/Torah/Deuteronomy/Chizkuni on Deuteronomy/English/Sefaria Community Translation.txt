Verse 6

(1) The Children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth-bene-jaakan, meaning do not say Aaron died at the Golden Calf affair at the beginning of the forty years and my[Moses] prayer didn't help him, because ultimately [as the pasuk shows us] Aaron died at the end of the forty years at Mount Hor at the same time as The Children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth-bene-jaakan after arriving there from Moserah.
