                "Rabbi Yitzchak said: [God] could have begun the Torah only from 'This month shall be to you' (Exodus 12:2), which is the first mitzvah (precept) which Israel was commanded. So what is the reason that [God] began with 'In the beginning'? Because of [the idea expressed in the verse]: '[God] has declared to His people the power of His works, in order to give them the heritage of the nations' (Psalms 111:6). Thus, should the nations of the world say to Israel: 'You are robbers, having conquered the lands of the seven [Canaanite] nations [by force],' [Israel] can say to them: 'The whole earth belongs to the Holy Blessed One; He created it and gave it to whomever He saw fit. By His will He gave it to [the Canaanite seven nations], and by His will He took it from them and gave it to us.'", 
                "<b>In the beginning (<i>Bereishit</i>), created:</b> This text says nothing if not 'interpret me' - as the Rabbis, of blessed memory, expounded upon it: [God created the world] for the sake of the Torah which is called \"the beginning (<i>reishit</i>) of [God's] way\" (Proverbs 8:22), and for the sake of Israel who were called \"the beginning (<i>reishit</i>) of [God's] grain\" (Jeremiah 2:3). And if you are coming to explain it according to its simple meaning, explain it thus: \"At the beginning of the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the earth was chaos and void and darkness... God said, 'let there be light.'\" And [the verse] is not coming to teach the order of the creation, to tell us that [the heavens and the earth] came first; since if it was coming to teach this, it should have written, \"<i>barishona</i> (at first), He created the heavens, etc.;\" as there is no [usage of the word,] <i>reishit</i> (beginning of), in the Bible except when it is connected to the word that is after it, such as \"In the beginning of the reign of Yehoiyakim\" (Jeremiah 26:1); \"the beginning of his kingdom\" (Genesis 10:10); \"the beginning of your grain\" (Deuteronomy 18:4). Here too, you would say, \"In the beginning of when God created, etc.,\" like \"In the beginning of His creating.\" And similar to it is (Hosea 1:2), \"At the beginning (<i>betechillat</i>) of God's speaking to Hoshea,\" which is to say the beginning of the Holy One's, blessed be He, speech to Hoshea, \"and God said to Hoshea, etc.\" And if you will [insist] that this is coming to teach that these were created first, and its explanation is, \"In the beginning of <i>everything</i>, God created [the heavens and the earth] - and you have [other] verses that abbreviate their language and omit a word, such as (Job 3:9), \"For He did not close the doors of my womb\" and it does not explain who is the closer; and such as (Isaiah 8:4), \"he will carry off the wealth of Damascus\" and it does not explain who will carry it off; and such as (Amos 6:12), \"for will they plow with cattle,\" and it does not explain it [to say], \"for will people plow with cattle;\" and such as (Isaiah 46:10), \"who tells the beginning (<i>reishit</i>) from the end,\" and it does not explain it [to say], \"who tells from the beginning of a matter, the end of the matter\" - if so, you should wonder about [what] you [are saying], since behold, the waters were earlier, since behold, it is written, \"and the spirit of God was hovering upon the waters,\" and [yet] the text did not reveal when the creation of water had been, but you have learned that the waters preceded the earth.  And also, that the heavens were created of water and fire [and so preceded the heavens]. Perforce, then, the verse is not teaching the order of what came earlier and what came later at all .  ",
