Mishnah Berurah

Siman 1

(1) IN ORDER TO SERVE HIS CREATOR - because for this was man created. As the text says "Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory... " And even if his Evil Inclination advises him in the winter and says 'How will you arise in the morning, because it is very cold?' or in the summer advises and says 'How will you arise from your bed, when you still have not slept to your satisfaction?' Overcome him and do not listen to him, and think to yourself: If I had needed to arise to appear before a king of flesh and blood, how carefully and zealously would I arise and awaken in order to prepare myself for this service? All the more so and obviously, before the King of kings the Holy One blessed is He. 
(2) THE DAWN - A secret in written in the Two Tablets of the Covenant, to connect the day and night with Torah and prayer, whether its morning or whether its evening. Immediately upon waking up from sleep if he doesn't plan to sleep more, he should wash his hands, even if he is does so while still lying down. All the more so, he shouldn't walk four cubits without having washed his hands. He must be very careful in this regard. And the holy Zohar emphasizes the great punishment for this, for leaving the spirit of impurity on himself. In any case, he should not God forbid violate any other prohibition in order to not have a gap before washing his hands; like for instance, to stop himself from urinating for this purpose, or to take water which his friend had prepared for himself, if its not obvious to him that he will immediately be able to give him other [water] in exchange. And there are those who fail in this. And if he sees that the water is far and he doesn't have someone to bring it close to him, it is the custom of some of the observant ones (ba'alei ha'nefesh) to walk little by little in increments shorter than four cubits. The Sha'arei Teshuvah write about this that its better if hes able to run and not allow the spirit of evil to linger on his hands. There are those who say in regards to this idea that the entire house is like his four cubits, but we shouldn't rely on this unless in a time of pressure. If when he arises at night he sees that he does not have enough water to wash his hands three times as it appropriate to rid the spirit of impurity, nevertheless he should not God forbid forgo his Torah study because of this until daylight, but rather he should wash his hands a little or clean his hands on whatever he has to wash, make a blessing, and learn, as per the law of the Talmud and Torah. 
(3) WHEN THE GROUP IS PRAYING - Even though the time for prayer has not passed, in any case he is commanded to pray with a group. This is elaborated below at the end of Seif Katan 9.
THE RIGHTEOUS - He should paint in his soul/mind always how to stand before Hashem blessed be his name, because The Holy One's glory fills all the land. And it is written in the name of the Arizal, that he should always paint the name YHV'H next to his eyes in the essence of Fear of Heaven, for this is Y-H-V-H (with the vowelization of the word Fear [YIR'AH]), for this is the secret of "I shall set the Lord before me always" and the is greatly benefits one's Fear of Heaven. There are those who are accustomed because of this to have parchments of a Menorah drawn inside their Siddurim, on which it is written "I shall set the Lord..." Etc..., with the Four Letters and other Names, and this Menorah is called "I have set" ["Shiviti"]. And the purpose is in order to remind one not to engage in idle chatter during God fearing prayer. And it is written in the Gates of Repentance [Sha'arei Teshuvah] 
(5)  BEFORE MEN - Never the less, he should never fight with them, because the quality of brazenness is very despicable, and its not appropriate to use it at all, even in the service of the Lord blessed be his name, because he the will acquire the attribute in his personality even in matters which are not in the service of Hashem. 
THAT ARE MOCKING YOU - If he's an average person who in the company of great men, he shouldn't be embarrassed to learn or to do the mitzvah. If its possible for him to perform it not directly in their presence, its even better. However, if you're in the presence of other average folk who would learn from him, then on could say, that it would be better to do it in their presence, so that they should learn from him how do as he has done. However, he should direct his heart [intention] to the Name of the Heaven, but not boastfully God forbid. 
AND WHEN HE IS ALONE - It means to say, even when he is in the privacy of his home, also he should be walking with the Lord his God, as [the Re'ma] concludes...
WITH ALACRITY - Not exactly, bur rather he should wait a bit and not get up immediately, because it is damaging for the body. It is good to say immediately upon rising "I am gratefully to you my eternal king who has returned my soul in kindess; great is your faith." It should be said with a pause after "kindness", and "great of your faith" without pause. And this is from as its written "renewal of mornings" etc..., that the Holy One Blessed be He upholds his faithfulness to returns the souls to its depositor in the morning. 

Siman 2



Siman 3

But Now etc: Because we do not have the presumption of being God fearing such that angels would be escorting us and that we would ask of them to wait for us until we exit.
Until Sitting: And in the same way, he shouldn't get up while he is revealed.
And Should Not Go (Together): And if he's afraid, one can put his hand on his head through the window, but only if he won't see his uncovering (Mishnah Brura: Siman 3, Seif 8), and it's even forbidden to enter with his wife, but with a small child who doesn't know, it's allowed to enter the bathroom.
And Should Not Speak: And if it's for a great need, it's allowed, as long as he isn't excusing himself. But while he is still excusing himself, even for a great need, it's forbidden. And if there's another person, close the door, and another man wants to enclose himself at the same time as him, they shouldn't speak. Only women talk when they go to a specific bathroom that is in public, like a bathroom that was in the field, back in the day, or in the courtyard of the synagogue. In these countries, the Sages said that they should talk to each other in order for their voices to be heard from outside, so a man won't enclose himself there and be alone with them (Sanhedrin 19), and therefore from there, they (women) go in twos to the bathroom.

"... and in His goodness are our lives. Blessed are You, God, our God, King of the universe, etc." - This implies that one does not say "Blessed is He, and Blessed is His name." But there are authorities who wrote to say "Blessed is He, and Blessed is His name," and so is the practice. And see in the Magen Avraham and in other Acharonim, that even so, this does not apply to an individual, and also with three, one should not say it; only the one blessing, and not the two who are invited with him.

The essence of the mitzvah of delight in Shabbat is explained to us by the prophets, as it says: “and you shall call the Sabbath a delight,” and there are authorities who believe that the essence is from the Torah, for Shabbat is part of the times that are called holy... as is explained in the Sifra... And our rabbis spoke highly of the importance of this mitzvah (in Shabbat 118)... And similarly in every location, one should delight in Shabbat according to the custom, with food and drink that is considered delight for them. And since in general, most people get their delight from meat and wine and sweets, therefore we learn...that one should have a lot of meat and wine and sweets according to one’s abilities.

Mitzvah etc. - Because of the honor of Shabbos. Nevertheless, it is not completely obligatory. If you do wash yourself, you recieve reward, If you don't, there is no punishment. Be very careful to not bathe for the mitzvah and have the concern of violating Shabbos. And with many sins, many fail in this in the winter days and short days that if wait a short amount, it will get dark. And even if you complete your washing permissibly, also be careful of a prohibition because at times you will comb your hair afterwards, which is a Torah violation of Shabbos. Also another thing that's found is to squeeze out the towel from the water that it was holding. This is the prohibition of M'chabeis (laundering). It is proper for all who fear god with their hearts, to warn the nation not to do this. And their is a principle that if the nation does a sin you could've stopped, you also recieve punishment. However, if you stop the nation from doing this, you are also rewarded. If you don't stop the people in your house, you get the sin of the people in your house. If you don't stop the people in your city, you get the sin of your city.
To wash - This mitzvah of washing also applies to women. And in winter days and short days in which you don't have time. Wash your face and hands. And even for men, if they don't have time.
All of your body - With hot water.
And legs - And now, it's not the custom to be careful with this. And in their countries they would walk barefoot and wash their feet in water because of the dirt and dust.
On Erev Shabbos - This also applies for Holidays. On Thursday, it's not considered in honor of Shabbos. If you can't wash on Erev Shabbos, it's better to wash as close to Shabbos as possible.

That is, they should be placed on or near it, and they should be carried together, and thereby the carrying will not be so recognizable even though the body is muzktzeh since they are being carried together. We only allow things to be moved with this mechanism, of a loaf or baby since it involves desecration of the dead, but not by other categories of muktzeh such as a rock or similar, like we write in seif 5

He should not order them... -- because this is similar to the construction of an ohel when he sets up the top [barrel] which acts as a roof on top of walls; similarly, just as [in the case of] an ohel one needs the air underneath, so too here the air between the barrels is necessary, as it (the wine) would grow mouldy without the air between them [Aharonim].

In remembrance of the joy of receiving the Torah:  for there were grasses around Mount Sinai, as it says "The flocks and cattle shall not graze..." Latter sages wrote that in places where it is the custom to give out fragrant grasses in the synagogue, they should not give them out from Barukh SheAmar until after the Amida, so that one may bless over them (the blessing for fragrant vegetation)-- because during that period it is forbidden to interrupt (the prayer).  There is a custom to stand trees in the synagogues and homes in remembrance that on Shavuot judgment takes place for the fruits of the tree.  The Gr"a abolished this custom because now it is the ritual of the (non-Jewish) nations to put up trees on their holiday.

Siman 495

All work that is forbidden on Shabbos is forbidden on Yom Tov, except for work of preparing food, and except for carrying and igniting, and also preparation for preparing food that was not able to be done the day before.

We are obliged to fast, etc.  This obligation derives from the words of the prophets, as it is written in Scripture (Zech. 8:19), "The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth..." Our Sages, may their memories be for a blessing, explained that "the fast of the fourth" is the 17th of Tammuz, since it is in the fourth month according to the way we count the months; that "the fast of the fifth" is the Tish'ah B'Av [the 9th of Av], since it is in the fifth month; that "the fast of the seventh" is the Fast of Gedalia, since it is in the seventh month [Tishrei]; and that "the fast of the tenth" is the 10th of Tevet, since it is in the tenth month.  On all of these days, all Israel fasts because of the misfortunes that befell them on these days, in order to arouse their hearts to open up to the paths of repentance [teshuvah].  This [fasting] will be a recollection of our evil deeds and the deeds of our ancestors which were like our deeds now, such that they caused them--and us--these misfortunes, and in the recollection of these things we will return [nashuv] to become better [people], as it is written (Lev. 26:40), "And they will confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their ancestors..."  Therefore, each person is obliged to take to heart on these days to examine their deeds and to repent [lashuv] of them, because the fast [itself] is not the essential [thing], as it is written [in Jonah 3:10] about the people of Nineveh: "And the Eternal saw their deeds, that they repented [turned back] from their evil path..." The Sages, may their memories be a blessing, said that their sackcloth and their fasting were not mentioned--just their deeds.  Fasting is nothing but a preparation for repentance.  Therefore, those people who, as they are fasting, go on walks or [pursue] trivial matters grasp the issue of secondary importance, but loses track of the essence.  But in any case, one may not exempt oneself by means of repentance alone, because to fast on these days is a positive commandment from the prophets, as we wrote above.
On account of the terrible things, etc. Because on 17 Tammuz five misfortunes occurred.  On it, the tablets were broken as Moses descended from the mountain, as is explained in the Torah [Ex. 32:19]; the daily offering was cancelled and was no longer sacrificed in the First Temple; [the walls of] the city [of Jerusalem] were breached [in advance] of the destruction of the Second Temple; the evil Apostomos burnt the Torah; and an idol was placed in the Holy Temple.  On on 9 Av, the great destruction occurred. The First Temple was destroyed on [that day], as was the Second; and on that very day it was decreed that our ancestors that were in the desert would not enter the land; and on that very day, [Romans] conquered a great town, called Beytar [during the Bar Kokhba revolt], which was home to thousands of Jews, all of whom fell into the hands of the idolaters and all of whom perished, which was a calamity as great as the destruction of the Temple; and on this very day, destined for calamity, the evil Turnusrufus plowed the Temple and its environs, thus fulfilling what was said: "Zion will be plowed as a field" (Jer. 26:18). And on the day of 3 Tishrei, Gedalia son of Ahikam was murdered.  He had been appointed to lead the remaining survivors after the the [first] destruction [and his death led to] the extinguishing of the remaining embers of Israel, because [in the wake of it] all were exiled and thousands were killed. And on 10 Tevet, the evil king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar assaulted Jerusalem and laid it under the siege and distress that led to the destruction.

Siman 549





...but they have the custom of being stringent... If they are weak, it would seem that they should not be stringent. In any case, even someone who needs to eat should not feast on meat and wine, but [should eat] only what they need.  And likewise, children who understand [enough] to mourn: although we are not obliged to educate them [to fast] even at age twelve and even for a fast of a few hours, it is in any case appropriate to educate them to eat just enough to sustain their bodies, water and other simple food as they require, in order that they will mourn with the community.
We are permitted to wash ourselves... Because at the time when [Israel] wished [to fast] and accepted upon themselves the obligation to fast on all four of these fasts, they did not accept upon themselves that [all four] would be as stringent a public fast as Tish'ah Be'Av, because the majority of the community would not be able to stand it.  So a pious person should be stringent on all of them as on Tish'ah Be'Av, but if one of them falls on the evening when [a man's wife is due to] immerse [after her period], he should fulfill his obligation [to have marital relations].  Likewise, a person should not be strict about wearing shoes in order not to be a laughingstock. Likewise, if the 10th of Tevet falls on Friday, a person should not be strict about not washing in hot water out of respect for Shabbat.
And it is not required ... while it is still day... [That is,] as is required on Tish'ah Be'Av. Rather, it is permitted to eat and drink during the evening [of these fasts].

It's a mitzvah to eat etc ... It's written "and you shall afflict your souls (fast) on the 9th of the month at the evening etc" (Vayikra 23:32). And from the facts that (a) it could've been written instead "on the 9th of the month you will afflict your souls (fast) until night etc" and (b) it is written "and you shall afflict ... on the night of the month," perhaps it comes to say that they should truly fast on the 9th. But yom kippur isn't on the ninth, it's on the tenth of the month! Chazal teach that it's a mitzvah from the Torah to eat on erev Yom Kippur and ha-kadosh-baruch-hu wishes to bestow rewar for the feasting as if it were fasting. This is not a comparable mitzvah to those that contain suffering. Like that they say ...

It is a good practice to bring... - In order to educate them in the commandment of publicizing the miracle.  For this reason the community is accustomed to read these verses out loud (infra, 690:17), which are the essence of the beginning of the miracle and its end, i.e. "There was a Jewish man," "And Mordechai went out," "For the Jews," "For Mordechai" - in order to wake up the little ones that they not sleep, and they will pay attention to the reading, and they read the verses to them to teach them (Levush).
Young boys and girls - So long as they do not bring very young ones, who confuse the listeners.
To hear, etc. - But now, in our many sins, it is reversed.  For not only do they not listen, but they mix it up so that the adults also cannot listen, and the only reason they come is to beat Haman.  In this way the father does not fulfill the commandment of education at all.  In truth, from the perspective of the commandment of education, every father has to keep his young children near him, and to supervise them that they listen to the reading, and when the reader gets to mentioning the name of Haman the Aggagite, the child is permitted to hit as is his custom, but not that that should be the primary purpose of bringing the child to the study hall.
The reading of the Megillah - And now, everyone should have a kosher megillah and read in an undertone word for word, because it is impossible to hear from the leader because of the noise and commotion, that they hit with sticks and make noise.  And it is appropriate for every Jew to behave this way if he can.  And see infra, 690:4.
