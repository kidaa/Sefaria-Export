Korach, etc. : It did not mention the second side [that opposed Korach],  which are Moshe and Aharon, like it mentioned two sides in the first disagreement. This is because they [the two disagreements] are not equal—for Moshe and Aharon, their intention was for heaven. And they did not have any aspect within them that was not for the sake of heaven.  [Their intentions were] for the sake of peace.
