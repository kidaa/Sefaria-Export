Mishneh Torah, Robbery and Lost Property

Chapter 1











Desire leads to coveting and coveting leads to robbery.  That if owners do not want to sell even if a great deal of money has been offered and pleading by friends, one is lead into robbery as it says, "They coveted houses and stole them (Micah 2:2)."  And if the owners stand against them to protect their property or prevent him from theft, he will be moved to shed bled.  Go and learn from the example of Achav and Navot.
