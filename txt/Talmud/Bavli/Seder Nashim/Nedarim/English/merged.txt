Daf 80b




























A spring belongs to the residents of the city, so if it comes to their lives against the lives of others, their lives come first, before the lives of others. 
If they must choose between their own animals and the animals of others, their own animals come first, before the animals of others. 
If they must choose between their own laundering and the laundering of others, their own laundering comes first, before the laundering of others
If, however, they must choose between the lives of others and their own laundering, the lives of others come first, before their own laundering.  However, Rabbi Yosei says 
that their own laundering comes first, before the lives of others.
