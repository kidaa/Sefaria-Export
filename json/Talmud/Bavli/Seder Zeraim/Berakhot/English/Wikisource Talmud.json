            "From the time when the kohanim    (priests) enter to eat their terumah (agricultural gifts) [i.e., sundown] until the end of the first watch [of the night]; this is the view of Rabbi Eliezer. ",

            "[It may be recited] until the break of dawn.", 
            "It once happened that [Rabban Gamliel’s] sons came [home late at night] from a place of feasting. They said to [their father]: ", 
            "“We have not recited the Shema.\" ",

[Another example:] All [sacrifices] which may be eaten for one day — the precept [of eating them can be performed] until the break of dawn. \"“If dawn has not broken, you are obligated to recite it.\"If so, why did the Sages say [that these precepts can be performed only] until midnight?",

            "If so, in the concluding Mishna, where it states: \"In the morning one says two blessings before [the Shema] and one after it, while in the evening one says two blessings before it and two after it,\" he should have dealt with the evening first! ",
