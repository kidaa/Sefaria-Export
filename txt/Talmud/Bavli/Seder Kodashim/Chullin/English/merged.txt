Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

Everyone [may] slaughter and his slaughter is valid: except  a deafmute, a simpleton or a minor, so that they will not spoil the slaughter. But [if they] all slaughter and others see them, their slaughter is valid.

Mishna: One who slaughters on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, even though he's liable for his soul, his slaughtering is Kosher.
Gamarra: Rav Huna says that Hiiya bar Rav expounded in the name of Rav, [that this slaughtered animal] is forbidden to eat on the day. The Yeshiva Bochrim in the academy came to think that this ruling of rag reflects the view of Rabbi Yehuda. Which of Rabbi Yehuda's mishnayot? It's Rabbi Yehuda about preparation. For it was taught in a mishnah that one can chop up gourds for an animal, or a carcass for a dogs. But Rabbi Yehuda says that if it wasn't a carcass as of shabbat eve, then it's forbidden...

Mishnah: In the case where one is obligated [in tithing] in bitter almonds they are exempt from sweet ones, when they are obligated in sweet ones, they are exempt from bitter ones.
Gemarra: The rabbis taught in a beraita, Almonds that are bitter and small are obligated. Big ones are exempt. Sweet ones that are big are obligated, while the small ones are exempt. Rabbi Yishmael in the name of Rabbi Yossi says in the name of his father: Both this one and that one are exempt. And some say [that he said] both this and this are obligated. Rabbi Ilai says....
Mishnah: The grape seeds that did not ferment, are not able to be redeemed with silver of tithe money, and they invalidate a mikvah. Once it ferments, it can be redeemed on silver of tithe money and does not invalidate a mikvah. Brothers that are in a partnership, when they are obligated in the Kalbon [extra bit on the shekel] they are exempt from the first born animal tithe, when they are obligated in  the first born animal tithe, then they are obligated in Kalbon.
Germara: Who is the author of our mishnah? It is not Rabbi Yehuda, nor is it the Rabbis. For it was taught in a Beraita, one who has temed and adds water in a certain quantity, and then [when removing the temed] finds it as it's [original] volume, he is exempt [from tithing], But Rabbi Yehudah obligates him [to tithe]. Who is it [the author of our mishnah] ? If it's the Rabbis, even though it fermented [they would still exempt him], if it was Rabbi Yehudah, even though it did not ferment [he would obligate in tithing].  Rabbi Nachman says in the name of Rabba Bar Avuah.

And Rava said ...
In the merit that our father Abraham said

Daf 89a

"whether from a string to a shoe strap" (Genesis 14:23) his sons merited to two commandments - to the string of techelet and the strap of phylacteries...
I can understand [why] the strap of tefillin [is cast as a reward], it is written
(Deut. 28:10) "And all the nations of the land will see that the name of God is called over you," and it is taught in a baraita Rabbi Eliezer the great says, 
these are the head tefillin,
but what of the string of techelet?
That it was taught, Rabbi Meir
says what distinguished techelet from all the colors?
Because techelet is similar to the sea, and the sea is similar to the firmament, and the firmament is similar to a sapphire stone, and a sapphire stone is similar to the throne of Glory, as it is written
"And they saw the God of Israel, and under his legs...", and it is written
"and like the appearance of the sapphire stone the likeness of the throne.

Mishnah: A thigh in which the sciatic nerve was cooked, if it has [enough] to give flavor [to the thigh], this [thigh] is forbidden. 
How do we measure it? Like meat [cooked] with a turnip.
A sciatic nerve that was cooked with other nerves, at a time when one [still] recognizes it, [the standard for forbidding] is when it gives flavor. If [it is] not [recognized], all of it is forbidden. And [in] broth, when it gives flavor. 
And so too with a piece of a nevelah [an improperly slaughtered animal of a permitted species], and so too with a piece of prohibited fish which was cooked with [other] pieces: at a time when one recognized them, [the standard] is when it gives flavor; and if [it is] not [recognized], they are all forbidden. And for the broth [the standard] is when it gives flavor.
Gemara: Says Shmuel:
This is only taught when it's boiled [with the nerve] in, but if it's roasted [with the nerve] in, peel and eat until you get to the nerve.

Daf 97a



Daf 97b









Rav Acha bar Rav asked Ravina, what's your understanding of what Shmuel says:
"Salted is like hot, pickled is like cooked", and Shmuel says:
"This is only taught when it's boiled [with the nerve] in, but if it's roasted [with the nerve] in, peel and eat until you get to the nerve."

Rav Asi asked Rabbi Yochanan
How long should one wait between [eating] meat and cheese?
He said,
"Not at all."
Really?  But Rav Chisda said,
One who eats meat isn't allowed to eat cheese, [one who eats] cheese is allowed to eat meat.
Rather [Rav Asi must have asked] How long should one wait between [eating] cheese and meat?...
He said,
"Not at all."
Regarding what we quoted above "Rav Chisda said,
One who eats meat isn't allowed to eat cheese,
[one who eats] cheese is allowed to eat meat."
Rav Aha bar Yosef said to Rav Chisda,
"The meat this is between the teeth, what do we make of it?"
We reference the verse, "The meat was still between their teeth" (Numbers 11:33)
Mar Ukva says,
In comparison to my father, regarding this matter, I am vinegar the son of wine.   My father, when he ate meat, would not eat cheese until the same time the next day.
But I, even if I won't eat it at this meal, I'll eat it at the next meal.

Daf 106a

[this demon entity] saw that they were spilling water out from the mouth of the pitcher, saying
...If I knew that you had the custom to do this, I would not have delayed
Upon Rav Dimi's coming he said;
... [failing to do] The first waters fed him pig meat, the last removed a woman from her husband
...Upon Ravin's arrival he said;
...[Failing to do] The first waters fed him neveilah meat, the last killed somebody
Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said; and your mnemonic [is this]
Rav Dimi came [the husband] removed her; Ravin came [and] killed her
... R' Abba taught; one of these [is not] and one of these [is] reflecting the most [more] severe
...It was told [about water] heated by fire
... Chizkiyah said;
...We cannot use them to wash the hands. But R'Yochanan said:
We can use them to wash the hands
R' Yochanan said:
I asked of Rabban Gamliel the son of Rebbi, and he was the one who ate only tohoros and he said to me:
All the great of Galil do so
the Hot springs of Tiberias; Chizkiyah said
We cannot use them to wash hands, but we can immerse hands in them.
but R' Yochenan said:
One may immerse his whole body in [the springs], but not his face, hands and feet.
...Now if one can immerse [submerge] his whole body in them, it is not certain [about] his face, hands and feet
...R'Papa said
...When they are in their place all agree that it is permitted

Daf 108a




... (M') [If] A drop of milk falls on a slice of meat and imparts a flavor to it, prohibited. 
If it falls into a [meat] soup and imparts a flavor, prohibited. 
...(G') Abaye said 
... [The issue of] Taste without the object [giving off the taste] is, in general, [prohibited] by the Torah. And if you should think that it is [only prohibited] by the Rabbis [and that the reason] that we don't learn it from [the prohibition of not mixing] meat and milk is because it is a new  case. But if this is a new case then it wouldn't matter about if it imparted taste [or not].
...Rava said in response:
...[only] cooking was prohibited by the Torah. 
...Rav said:
...When the contact happens and the taste is transferred the mixture is forbidden like neveilah which can in turn render other pieces [of meat] prohibited, because they are the same type of substance.

Daf 111b












Says Rav Yehuda in the name of Shmuel:
It's prohibited to eat hot food in a dish that was used to salt meat.
and Shmuel is self consistent, since he says:
"Salted is like hot, pickled is like cooked."

Daf 112a














[...] There was a bird that fell into a jar of <i>kamka</i> [milk based food]. Rav Hinena bar Rava of Pashrona permitted it.
Says Rava:
Who is wise enough to permit in this way if not Rav Hinena bar Rava of Pashrona!
He reasons:
When Shmuel said "Salted is like hot...", it's only when it can't be eaten because of its saltiness. This <i>kutcha</i> [=<i>kamka</i>] can be eaten even with its saltiness.
And this statement is when it's raw, but roasted, it needs [removal of] a peel.
And if it has cracks, the whole thing is prohibited. and it it's spiced, it's prohibited.
