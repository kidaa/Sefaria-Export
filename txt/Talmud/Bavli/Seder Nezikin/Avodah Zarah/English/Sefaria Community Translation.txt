Daf 2b



Daf 3a



Is it not taught: R. Meir used to say. 
‘Whence do we know that even an idolater who studies the Torah is equal to a High Priest? 
From the following verse: 
Ye shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances which, if a man do, he shall live by them. It does not say "If a Priest, Levite, or Israelite do, he shall live by them," but "a man"; here, then, you can learn that even a heathen who studies the Torah is equal to a High Priest!’ 
What is meant, then, is that they are rewarded not as greatly as one who does a thing which he is bidden to do, but as one who does a thing unbidden. For, R. Hanina said: 
He who is commanded and does, stands higher then he who is not commanded and does....

R. Yehoshua ben Levi said
Israel made the (golden) calf only to provide an opening for those who seek to return (ba'alei t'shuvah) as it is written:
'Would that it were possible that these feelings would stay with them and they would revere me forever...'

Daf 19a






























Rava said,
"Truly, a person should study Torah in the area that his heart desires, as it is stated, 
'But in the Torah of God is his desire.'"
And Rava  said, 
"At first it is associated with the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and finally it is associated with his name, as it is stated 
'In the Torah of God is his desire, and in His (read here as 'his') Torah he will toil day and night.'"
































(Psalms 1:3) "And he shall be like a tree replanted by streams of water." The disciples of R. Yanai said, 
"[It says] 'a tree replanted' and not 'a tree planted' [to teach us that] anyone that only learns Torah from one teacher will never see any blessing."

Daf 19b



Daf 20a

For Scripture says (Deuteronomy 7:2) "nor show mercy unto them" - do not grant them occupation of the land.
But "nor show mercy unto them" is needed for this: The Merciful One is saying,
"Do not grant them favor."
If so, Scripture should have said
"nor show mercy unto them" [spelled with a vav]. What does "nor show mercy unto them" [spelled without a vav] mean?
This implies two things.
But it is still [otherwise] required, for this is what the Merciful One is saying:
"Do not give them free gifts."
If so, Scripture should have said "nor give freely unto them" [spelled with a yod]. What does "nor show mercy unto them" [spelled without a yod] mean?
This implies all of the above.
There is also a <i>beraita</i> accordingly:
"Nor give freely unto them" - do not grant them occupation of the land.
Alternatively,
"nor give freely unto them" - do not grant them favor.
Alternatively,...
"nor give freely unto them" - do not give them free gifts.

Daf 27a

It has been stated: From where do we know that circumcision by a non Jew is invalid? Daru b. Papa said in the name of Rav: You shall keep my covenant (Gen 17:9). R. Yohanan said: Circumcised he hall be circumcised (Gen 17:13) - he who is circumcised shall circumcise.
Rather there is between them - a woman. He who said: You shall keep my covenant - this isn't a possibility, for a woman isn't a bat- mila, and he who said Circumcised he shall be circumcised - this is a possibility, for  a woman, too, is as if she is circumcised. 
And is there anyone who could say that a woman isn't able to? But it says: "So Zipporah took a flint an cut off her son's foreskin" (Ex 4:25)! Read it as:"she caused someone to take". But is says, "and cut off"! Read it as:"she caused someone to cut off". And if you want, you can say, she started it, and Moshe came and finished it.

Because of removing [the sciatic nerve]
