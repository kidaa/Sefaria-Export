"The LORD is my light." Yirah is from something that is known, and pahad is from something unknown. When a person is fearful from revealed enemies who battle with him, that is called yirah. Corresponding to this it says...
That "The Lord is my light and my salvation, from whom shall I fear." This means as follows. It can be pictured that a person fears from his enemies, 1. lest they fall upon him in the night when he can not see them and protect himself from them. Corresponding to this it says "God is my light." 2. Lest their troops and their strength be greater than his troops and strength. Corresponding to this it says "God is my salvation" and so "from whom shall I fear." And when a person fears from his enemies who are plotting evil against him secretly to destroy  his tree and its fruit [based on Jeremiah 11:19] and he does not know, this is called pahad, and corresponding to this it says afterwards
