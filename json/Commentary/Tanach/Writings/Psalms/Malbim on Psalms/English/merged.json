Corresponding to this it says \"God is my salvation\" and so \"from whom shall I fear.\" And when a person fears from his enemies who are plotting evil against him secretly to destroy  his tree and its fruit [based on Jeremiah 11:19] and he does not know, this is called pahad, and corresponding to this it says afterwards"
