Perek 1













In the hour when the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the first person, He showed him all the trees of the Garden of Eden. He said to him, "See my works, how pleasant and praiseworthy they are. All of this I created for you. Be careful that you do not ruin and destroy my world, for if you ruin it there is no one who will repair it after you."
