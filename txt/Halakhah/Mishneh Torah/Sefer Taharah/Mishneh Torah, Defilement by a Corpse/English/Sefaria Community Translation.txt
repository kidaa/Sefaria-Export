Mishneh Torah, Defilement by a Corpse

Chapter 1

A corpse defiles (renders ritually impure) through contact, by being carried, and by [being under the same] tent (anything that creates a roof) an impurity of seven days. And the impurity [passed on through] contact and a tent are explicit in the Torah, as it is written (Numbers 19:11), "One who touches a corpse, of any human soul; and he will be impure for seven days;" and (Ibid. 14) "anyone who comes [into] a tent and anyone who is in the tent will become impure for seven days."
The impurity [passed on through] carrying is [known] from tradition. And the matter is an a fortiori argument (<i>kal vechomer</i>): If the impurity of a carcass, which is an impurity of [only] an evening and does not pass on impurity in a tent, [nonetheless] passes on impurity by being carried, as it is stated, (Leviticus 11:28), "he who carries their carcass;"  is it not all the more so with a corpse. And just like the carcass, that has an impurity of contact for one evening and its impurity of carrying is [also] for one evening; so too, the corpse that has an impurity of contact for seven days, its impurity of carrying is [also] for seven days. The impurity of a carrying a corpse is not rabbinic but a law of the Torah. And it appears to me that the verse was silent about it in the same way that it was silent about the prohibition of a daughter - since it explicitly forbade even the daughter of a daughter; and [like] it was silent about the prohibition of eating meat with milk - since it explicitly  forbade even its cooking. So [too], it was silent about the impurity of carrying a corpse - since it explicitly defiled even the impurity of its tent; all the more so [does] its carrying [cause defilement]. 
The impurity of contact that is mentioned in all places - whether with a corpse or whether with other sources of defilement - is when a person touches the actual impurity with his flesh; whether it is with  his hand or whether it is with his foot or whether it is with the other parts of his flesh - and even if it is with his tongue - behold, he becomes impure. And it also appears to me that if he touches [it] with his nails or his teeth, he becomes impure; since they are connected to the body, they are like the body. But if one stuffs impurity into a reed and puts it into the throat of a pure person, and [the actual impurity] did not touch his tongue; or put it [similarly enclosed] into the womb of a woman from below, and not [have] it touch her flesh; the one who swallows it does not become impure from this contact. Since behold, it did not touch his flesh, as internal contact is not [considered] contact. 
Behold, a scab over a wound, is [considered to be] like the skin of the flesh concerning the contact of impurities. And fuzz that is on an infant is not [considered to be] like the skin of the flesh. How is this? One who has an impurity touch the scab of his wound becomes impure as if it touched his skin; if it touched on the thin hair that is on the flesh of an infant, [the infant] does not become impure. And so [too, with] an impure person that had a wound - if a pure person touched him on the scab of the impure person's wound, he becomes impure; if the infant was impure and the pure person touched him on his fuzz, he does not become impure; whether with the impurity of a corpse or whether with other impurities. And so [too] with moist feces or clay and similar [items] from the things that do not constitute a separation on the body; and so [too] with dry feces [as an example] of the things that do constitute a separation on the body; [all of them] are not like the skin of the flesh, not to  pass on impurity and not to receive impurity.
Just as a man is made impure by contact with impurity, so too do vessels (<i>kelim</i>) become impure upon the contact of impurity on them; except for earthenware vessels, which only become impure from [the impurity being in] its interior, as will be elucidated in the Laws of Vessels. [And this is an important principle in impurity: Anything that defiles a person by contact [also] defiles vessels, and anything that does not defile a person by contact [also] does not defile vessels; and a person and vessels only receive impurity from a primary source (<i>av</i>) of impurity.]   
The impurity of carrying that is mentioned in all places - whether with a corpse or whether with other sources of defilement by carrying - is when a person carries the impurity. Even if he does not touch it - even if there is a stone between him and it - since he carried it, he becomes impure.  It is the same if he carries it on his head or on his hand, or on the rest of his body; and it is the same if he carries it, himself, or someone else carries it and places it on top of [him]; in any case, he becomes impure. And even it the impurity was hanging by a string or by his hair and he [took] the string in his hand and raised the impurity a tiny bit; behold it is [considered] carrying and he becomes impure. 
Moving is within the category of carrying, and [so] anything that passes on impurity by being carried, [also] passes on impurity by being moved. How is this? A beam, that is suspended upon a wall, and has a corpse or a carcass or something similar to it on [one end] - if a pure person comes and moves the other end of the beam, once he has moved the impurity on the other end, [he is] impure, as a result of 'carrying' [it]. And it is not necessary to say that if he pulls one end towards the ground until he raises the impurity [on the other end] or he drags the impurity on the ground, it is [considered] 'carrying,' of course. And this and all that is similar to it is the impurity of moving (<i>hesit</i>) that is mentioned in every place. 
If one carries [an impurity] within his internal cavities, he becomes impure; as even though contact there is not [considered] contact, the one who carries there is [considered] carrying. [This is true] unless the impurity is swallowed into his intestines, since once it reaches his stomach, it is neither [considered] contact nor carrying. And if he immersed [in a requisite body of water to change his impure status], he becomes pure even though the impurity is within his intestines.  
Only people become impure through carrying, not vessels. How is this? Behold, if one had in his hand ten vessels - one on top of the other - and the carcass or something similar to it was on the top vessel, the person is impure because of carrying a carcass; and the vessels on his hand are all pure except for the top vessel, which was touched by the impurity. And so [too], that which is similar to this.
The impurity of a tent is not [existent] with other impurities but only with a corpse. And whether a person or a vessel forms a roof - even a needle that forms a roof - over the corpse; or whether the corpse forms a roof over a person or over vessels; or whether the corpse was with a person or with vessels under one [roof], behold they are impure.  
The impurity of a tent that is mentioned in all places is when that impurity defiles a person or vessels in one of these three ways: One who comes into a tent of a corpse, or one who partially comes in, behold, that one has become impure from the tent - even if he [only] brought his head or his fingertips or his nose into the tent of the corpse, behold, all of him has become impure; if he touched the lintel of a door and attached his hand to the lintel, he becomes impure as if part of him came in; if he touched the doorway - form the [height] of a handbreadth and down close to the ground, he is pure, and from the handbreadth and above, he is impure. And it appears to me that this [last] matter is [rabbinic].  
It is the same if the corpse is from Israel or from the nations, it passes on impurity though contact and by carrying [it].
And a gentile [corpse] does not pass on impurity in a tent. And this matter is a tradition (and not explicitly stated in the Torah). And behold, it states in the war of Midian (Numbers 31:19), "any one who touches a corpse," and it does not mention a tent over there.  And so [too], a gentile does not become impure by a corpse, but rather a gentile that touches a corpse or carries it or forms a roof over it, behold he is like someone who has not touched [it]. To what is this similar? To an animal that touched a corpse or formed a roof over a corpse. And not only with the impurity of a corpse but with all of the impurities - with all of them; a gentile and an animal do not become impure. 
And it is from [rabbinic law] that gentiles should be [considered] like a <i>zav</i> (someone who has certain types of atypical genital discharges, which cause impurity) in all of their matters. And you will not find in all the types of living souls that which becomes impure while it is alive or imparts impurity while it is alive except for man alone, and that is [the case only] if he is from [the People of] Israel. It is the same if he is an adult or he is a child, he can become impure from all of the impurities, even the impurity of a corpse, about which it states (Numbers 19:20), "a man who becomes impure;" it is the same if he is a man or a child, since behold, it states there (Ibid. 19:19), over all of the... souls that were there." Even a child who is a day old who touched or lifted or constituted a roof over a corpse becomes impure and behold, he is impure from a corpse. And that is [the case] when he is born after nine [months], but one born of eight [months], behold he is like a stone and [so] does not receive impurity.  
A corpse does not impart impurity until its soul departs. Even if his veins are cut or he is about to die, even if his [trachea and esophagus] have been sliced, he does not impart impurity until his soul departs, as it is stated (Numbers 19:13), "with the soul of a man that dies." If his spine is broken and most of his flesh with it, or he is split from the back like a fish, or his head is chopped off or he is cut into two parts in his stomach, behold, this one imparts impurity, even though he is still quivering in one of his limbs.
