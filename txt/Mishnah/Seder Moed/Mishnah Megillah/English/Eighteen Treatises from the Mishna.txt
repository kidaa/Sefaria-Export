Mishnah Megillah

Chapter 1

The Meguillah is read [sometimes] on the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, or on the 15th [of the month Adar], neither earlier nor later. Cities which, from the time of Joshua, the son of Nun, were surrounded with walls, read it on the 15th. Villages and large [open] towns shall read it on the 14th, but inhabitants of villages may read it in advance on the day of assembly.
How is this [to be understood]? When the 14th happens on Monday, inhabitants of villages and of large [open] towns shall read it on that day, and those of walled cities on the day following. When it happens on Tuesday or Wednesday, the inhabitants of villages shall read it in advance on [the preceding Monday] the day of assembly, those of large [open] towns on that day [viz. on the 14th] and those of walled towns on the day following. When it happens on Thursday, inhabitants of villages and of large [open] towns shall read it on that day, and those of walled towns on the day following. If it happen on Friday, the inhabitants of villages shall read it in advance on [the preceding day] the day of assembly, and those of large [open], and of walled towns, on that day [viz. on the 14th]. When it happens on the Sabbath, inhabitants of villages and of large [open] towns shall read it in advance on [the preceding Thursday,] the day of assembly, and those of walled towns on the day following [the Sabbath]. 6 When it happens on Sunday, inhabitants of villages shall read it on [the preceding Thursday] the day of assembly, and those of large [open] towns on that day [i.e. on the 14th], and those of walled cities on the day following.
What must be considered as a large [open] town? Any town in which there are ten unemployed men. Should there be less than that number, it is [legally] considered as a village. It was said with respect to these, that "it may be done sooner, but not later," but the time of the delivery of wood for the priests, the fast on the 9th of Ab, the festive sacrifice, and the day of assembly [of the people], are to be postponed to a later day, but must not be kept before [their proper time] and although it was said [in respect to the reading of the Meguillah] that it may be done earlier, but not later, it is yet permitted on these days to pronounce funeral orations, and to fast on them; also to give the alms [obligatory to be given] to the poor [on Pureem]. R. Jehudah says, "When [is it allowed to read the Meguillah before its proper time]? In places where it is customary [for the country people] to assemble [in the towns] on Mondays and Thursdays; but where that does not take place, it [the Meguillah] may only be read on its proper day."
If the Meguillah had been read in the 1st Adar, and the year declared [by the Sanhedrin] to be intercalary, it must be again read in the 2nd Adar. There is no difference between the ‏פורים‎ of the 1st Adar, and that in the 2nd, but the reading of the Meguillah and the gifts to the poor [which are obligatory on the 2nd].
There is no difference between the Sabbath and festivals, except the preparation of food. There is no difference between the Sabbath and the day of atonement, excepting that those who knowingly and wilfully profane the Sabbath are punished by man, whilst those who wilfully profane the day of atonement are punished [by God] by utter excision.
There is no difference between one who by vow has interdicted himself from receiving any benefit from another, and one whose vow was limited to the interdiction of accepting any food from another, except that it is not lawful for the first to set his foot in the house [or property] of the other, and to borrow vessels [of the other] which are not used for the preparation of food. There is no difference between vows and freewill-offerings, except that in the case of the first mentioned, the person who thus vows is liable for the risk, but he is not liable for the last mentioned.
There is no difference between a person labouring under an [involuntary] emission [of semen] who has experienced it twice [on the same day, or on two following days], and one who has experienced it thrice [in the same time, or within three days], excepting that the last mentioned must bring a sacrifice. There is no difference between a leprous person who has only been shut up, and one [whom the priest has] declared as leprous, excepting that the latter must go with rent clothes, and suffer the hair of his head to grow wild. There is no difference between the leper declared clean after being shut up, and one who has been cured of that disease, excepting that the latter must be shaved, and bring offerings of birds.
There is no difference between the [Holy] books and Tephilin [Phylacteries] and Mezuzzoth [scrolls placed on the door posts (Deut. 6:8-9)], except that the first mentioned may be written in any language, but the latter in Hebrew only. Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel says, "The permission to write the [Holy] books [in another language] was limited to the Greek language only."
There is no difference between a high priest anointed with the sacred oil, and one whose dignity was marked by additional [sacerdotal] vestments only, except the bull which the first mentioned is to offer, in case he gave a wrong decision, which led to a transgression of a precept [of the law]. There is no difference between an officiating high priest and his late substitute, except the bull offered on the day of atonement, and the tenth of the ephah [of flour] [which the first mentioned, or real high priest, alone might offer].
There is no difference between a large high place and a small one, except the paschal offering. This is the rule:—All offerings which are brought in consequence of vows, and all peace-offerings, may be offered on a small high place, but not sacrifices of any other kind.
There was no difference between [the tabernacle at] Shiloh and [the temple at] Jerusalem, except that at the former place it was lawful to eat of sacrifices having a minor degree of holiness, and of the second tithe, in any place from whence [Shiloh] might be seen; but in Jerusalem it was lawful to eat these within the walls only. In both places, however, sacrifices which were most holy might only be eaten within the hangings [of the court of the sanctuary]. The holiness of Shiloh had [subsequently] a period in which it became lawful [to offer sacrifices elsewhere]; but the holiness of Jerusalem has no such period.

Chapter 2

Any one who reads the Megillah in an irregular manner, does not acquit himself of his obligation; nor in case he reads it by heart, or translated in any language he does not understand; but it is lawful to read it to those who understand foreign languages, 1 in that foreign language. One who speaks a foreign language, who has it read to him in Hebrew, will be released from his obligation.
Should any person read it so as to make long pauses between the parts, and slumber meanwhile, he will be released from his obligation. If any one should read the Megillah whilst writing, expounding, or correcting it, with intention of thereby becoming released from his obligation, he will have fulfilled it, but not if he had no such intention. If the Megillah was written with paint, ruddle, gum, vitriol black, on papyrus, or on rough vellum, the obligation is not properly fulfilled; but it must be written in Hebrew characters, on good parchment, and with ink.
If an inhabitant of an [open] town had gone to an [anciently] walled town, or one of [an anciently] walled town had gone to an [open] town; if he intend to return [when the Meguillah is read] to his place, he shall read it at the same time they read it in his place; if not, he shall read it with the inhabitants of the place in which he then is. From when is it necessary to have commenced the reading of the Megillah, so as to have duly fulfilled the obligation? R. Meir says, "It is obligatory to read the whole thing." Rabbi Yehudah says, "It suffices if he commenced from the verse <i> Ish Yehudi</i>‎ (Esther 2:5)." Rabbi Yose says, "[Even if] from ‏the verse <i> Achar Hedevarim Haeleh</i> (Esther 3)."
All are qualified to read the Megillah, with the exception of a deaf or a foolish person, or a minor; but Rabbi Yehudah allows it to be said by a minor. The following religious acts may not be done before sun-rise on the day on which they are obligatory, viz.:—To read the Meguillah, to circumcise, to bathe [on the seventh day of the purification of an unclean or defiled person], to sprinkle [the unclean as a purification]; nor may a woman [who had experienced her menses beyond the usual time, and who was to] wait a day [before she might bathe] do so before the sun-rise of that day. But if any of these acts have been done at any period after day-break, they are valid.
The following religious acts may be done during the whole of the day [on which they are obligatory], viz.:—The reading of the Megillah; of the Hallel; the sounding of the cornet; the use of the loolab, or palm-branch; the prayer at the additional offering; the additional offering; the confession of sin on sacrificing the bulls; the confession to be made on bringing the [second] tithe; the confession of sin by the high priest on the day of atonement; the imposition of hands [on a sacrifice]; the slaughtering of a sacrifice; the waving of the offering; the bringing it to the altar; the taking of the handful of flour (Lev. 2:2); the burning with incense of the fat of a sacrifice on the altar; the pinching or wringing off the head of fowls brought as sacrifices (Lev. 1:15); the receiving of the blood of a sacrifice; the sprinkling thereof on the altar; the giving the bitter waters to drink to a woman suspected of adultery; the striking off of the heifer's neck (Deut. 21:4); and the purification of a leprous person.
The following acts may be done during the whole of the night: the cutting of the sheaves for the "omer," and the burning with incense of the fat and members of a burnt-offering on the altar (Lev. 6:9). This is the rule:—Whatever is commanded to be done by day, may legally be done during the whole of the day; and whatever is commanded to be done by night, it is lawful to do during the whole of the night.

Chapter 3

Inhabitants of a town who have sold the open [or marketplace] of the town, may buy for that money a synagogue. The money obtained by the sale of a synagogue, they may apply to the purchase of an ark [to keep the rolls of the Holy Law in]; for that obtained by the sale of such an ark, cloaks or wrappers for the rolls of the Holy Law may be purchased; for the produce of such wrappers, sacred books may be purchased; for the produce of sacred books, a roll of the Holy Law may be purchased; but if they had sold a roll of the Holy Law, it will not be lawful to apply that money for the purchase of [other] sacred books, nor wrappers for the proceeds of sacred books, nor an ark for the proceeds of wrappers, nor a synagogue with the proceeds of an ark, nor an open [or market] place with the money obtained by the sale of a synagogue, and even so in respect to any surplus fund. According to Rabbi Meir, it is unlawful to sell sacred public property to private individuals, because its sanctity becomes thereby lowered: but the sages replied, "If so, it would be also prohibited for a large town to sell sacred things to a smaller one."
A synagogue may, according to Rabbi Meir, only be sold on condition that it may at any time be repurchased by the original owners; but the sages permit it to be sold permanently, only it may not be sold to be applied to the following occupations: namely, as a bathing-house, as a tanning place [or pit], as a diving-bath, and as a laundry. Rabbi Yehudah says, "It may be sold on the condition that it be made an open court, and then the purchaser is at liberty to turn it to what purpose he pleases."
Rabbi Yehudah teaches also, that no funeral orations may be delivered in a synagogue which had become ruinous, nor may it be used as a rope-walk, nor to spread nets therein [to dry], nor to spread fruit on its roof, nor to use it as a short cut, as it is said (Lev. 26:31), "I will bring your sanctuaries into desolation," that is, they remain sanctuaries even in their desolation. If grass spring up therein, it may not be pulled up, that the view may contribute to the affliction [of the beholder].
When the new moon of Adar happens on a Sabbath, the section Shekalim (Exod. 30:11), is to be read; if it happen on any other day, that section must he read on the preceding Sabbath, and nothing additional is read on the following Sabbath. On the second, the section ‏of <i>Zachor</i> (Deut. 15:14), is to be read; on the third, that of the red heifer, ‏<i> Parah</i> (Num. 19); on the fourth, that of ‏<i>Hachodesh</i>  (Exod. 17); on the fifth, they return again to the regular order. The regular order [of Aphtoroth] is also to be interrupted on the feast of new moon, on that of dedication, on Pureem, and on public fast-days, also on the fast of the standing men.
On [the first day of] Passover, the section in Leviticus relative to the festival must be read; on the feast of weeks, that commencing, "Seven weeks shall you count," (Deut. 16); on the feast of new year, the section commencing, "In the seventh month, on the first day of the month" (Num. 29:1); on the day of atonement, that of ‏ <i>Acharei</i> (Lev. 16); on the first day of the feast of tabernacles, the section in Leviticus relative to the festivals must be read; and on the other days of that festival, the offerings for each day (Num. 29:17).
On Hanukkah, the section of the offerings of the princes (Num. 7) must be read; on Purim, that of ‏<i>Vayavoh Amalek</i>   (Exod. 9:8); on the feast of new moon, ‏<i> Uverashei Chodshaichem</i>‎ (Num. 18:11); on the fast-days for the standing men, the history of the creation (Gen. 1);  on fast-days, the section containing the blessings and maledictions (Lev. 26:3), the denunciations therein contained must be read without interruption, namely, one man must read the whole [chapter]. On Mondays and Thursdays, and on the Sabbath afternoon, they shall read the section of the law in its regular order, but these readings are not available to reduce the regular number: for it is said, Lev.23:44, "Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed festivals of the Lord," whence it is inferred, that each section must be read on the appointed festival to which it refers.

Chapter 4

The Megillah may be read either sitting or standing, by one person only, or by two persons at the same time, they alike fulfil their obligation. In places where it is usual to say a blessing [after reading it], it is obligatory to say it, but not where it is not customary. Three men are called [to read in the Holy Law] on Mondays and Thursdays; and in the afternoon of the Sabbath, neither more nor less than that number may be called, nor shall any section from the Prophets then be read. He who commences the reading of the Holy Law, shall say the [first] blessing before reading it, and he who concludes the reading, shall say the last blessing to be said after reading it.
On the feast of new moon, on the middle-days of the festivals, four men are to be called; this number may neither be added to, nor diminished, nor shall any section in the Prophets then be read. The first of these [men] shall say the [first] blessing before reading, and the last, who concludes the reading, shall say the last blessing after reading. This is the rule: on all days when an additional offering is prescribed, and which are not festivals, four men are to be called; five on festivals; six on the day of atonement; and seven on the Sabbath; this number may not be diminished, but it may be increased, and a section from the Prophets must be read on those days. The first of those who then read in the Holy Law, shall say the blessing before reading, and he who concludes the reading, shall say the last blessing after reading.
The Shema may not be repeated, nor may any one go before the ark, nor may priests raise their hands [to say the priest's blessing], nor may they read in the Torah, nor read a section from the Prophets; nor may they perform the funeral halts , nor may the blessing for mourners be said, nor the seven blessings said on the celebration of a marriage, neither may the the [Divine] name mentioned, when less than ten [men] are present. And on an occasion of redeeming land that has been consecrated, it is necessary that at least nine Israelites and a Cohen [priest] shall be present, and the same also at the valuation of a man.
Not less than three verses of the Holy Law may be read in the synagogue to each person [called to read]. One verse only of the law may at one time be read to the meturgeman, or interpreter, 8 but it is lawful to read three consecutive verses to him from the Prophets, but if each verse should form a separate section, one verse only may be read to the meturgeman at a time. Passages may be skipped over  in the reading of the Prophets, but not in that of the Holy Law. What time may be suffered to elapse to skip from one passage to another? While the meturgeman does not conclude his interpretation.
Whoever is to say in the public [synagogue] the section from the Prophets, in [the] public [synagogue] shall also there publicly recite the <i>Shema</i>, and act as minister before the <i>tevah</i> [reading-desk], and [if a cohen] shall say the blessing of the priests; if a minor, his father, or teacher, shall act for him.
A minor may read in the law [in the synagogue], and act as meturgeman, but may not publicly recite the Shema, nor act as minister at the tebah, nor [if a priest] say [by himself] the blessing of priests. If ones clothes are torn, so that his arms and legs appear, or, as others explain it, one whose legs and arms are quite bare,] may repeat the <i>Shema</i>, and act as the translator, but he may not read in the Holy Law, nor act as minister before the <i>tevah</i>, nor [if he is a priest] say the blessing of priests; a blind person may repeat the <i>Shema</i>, and act as translator; but Rabbi Yehudah says, "One who never beheld the light [that is, was born blind], may not repeat the <i>Shema</i>."
A priest whose hands are deformed, may not raise them [to bless the people]. Rabbi Yehudah also prohibits it to a priest whose hands are stained with woad or with madder roots, because the people stare at him.
A person who should say, "I will not minister at the tebah in coloured clothes," may not be permitted to do so in white ones; if he refuses to minister with sandals to his feet, he may not be permitted to minister barefooted. A person who makes the tephilin round, endangers himself, and has not properly observed the commandment; a person who places them [low down] on his forehead, or on the palm of his hand, acts in a heretical manner: if he cover them with gold, he imitates the opponents of tradition.
A person who, in his prayers to the Almighty, says, "The good shall [alone] bless thee," acts in a heretical manner; if he says, "Even to birds’ nests were thy mercies extended," or, "For thy goodness be thy name remembered," or one who says twice, "Modim" [in the Amidah], he shall be silenced [by authority]. Also, whoever explains the text (Lev. 18:21), <i>Umizaracho lo titen laehavir lamolech</i> to mean, "Thou shalt not give thy seed to an Aramite [heathen] woman," and those who explain figuratively the section in the law relating to the prohibition of carnal intercourse between relatives (Lev. 18), shall be silenced, and publicly reprimanded.
The occurrence of Reuben with Billah is to be read without being interpreted; that of Tamar [and Amnon] is to be read and interpreted. The [first part of the] occurrence with the golden calf is to be read and interpreted; but the second part [commencing Exod. 34:21] is to be read, without being interpreted. The blessing of the priests, and the occurrence of David and Amnon, are neither to be read nor interpreted; the description of the Divine chariot (Ezek. 1), is not to be read as an Aphtorah [section from the Prophets], but R. Jehudah permits it; R.abbi Eleazar says, neither (Ezek. 16), "Cause Jerusalem to know her abomination,"
