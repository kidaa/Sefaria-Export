            "Nachum the Midianite says, \"One day in the Diaspora before their [the idolaters] festivals, it is forbidden [for the Jews to do business with them].\" What do these words refer to? These refer to their festivals that have fixed dates. But if they are fixed, it is only forbidden [to do business] on that day. Although they [the anonymous rabbis] said, \"Three days it is forbidden to sell or to buy with them.\" What do these words refer to? To a matter [of business] that is finished, but to a matter that is not yet fulfilled, it is permitted [to do business]. Even a matter that is finished regarding buying or selling is permitted. R. Yehoshua ben Qarchah says, \"Every lender with a document [guaranteeing a loan] may not be repaid by them [the idolaters on a festival day], and the one without a document may be repaid by them because it is like a protector from their hand.\" ", 
            "2. Let him not not buy or sell with an idolater on the day of his festival. Let him not \"lighten his head\" with him [through drink?]. Let him not greet him in a place that is thought to have idolatry[?], for greeting someone is tantamount to honoring him. Let them greet idolaters on their festival days for the sake of peace. Jewish artisans who work besides an idolater in a Jewish home, it is permitted [to greet them], but in an idolater's home it is forbidden. R. Shimon b. Elazar says, \"If he was a hired worker for the day, whether he worked in the home of a Jew or an idolater, it is forbidden [to greet an idolater]. If he was a hired worker under a Jewish home, it is permitted, but in an idolater's  home, it is forbidden. If he is working in a fixed place[?], whether it is in the home of a Jew or an idolater, it is forbidden. In another city, either way it is permitted [to greet]. And although he finished making an idolater's tool before the idolater's festival day, he may not bring it to him because his home would rejoice.\" One city does [idolatry?] and another city does not, one nation does and another does not, one family does and another does not. The ones who do are forbidden and the one who do not are permitted. Calends. Though everyone does [idolatry?], only the worshipers are forbidden. Saturnalia. The day in which he seized control, Krateisis. The Day of Genusia [Birthday] of the kings of the idolaters is the day of each king and the day in which he like the rabble. An individual, even the day of his banquet and the day in which in which he took control. R. Meir says, \"Even the day in which he was sick, it is forbidden [to do business].\"", 
            "One may not go to a [idolatrous] market-place that is in a village or in any of the surrounding cities because it looks like he is going to the market-places in those cities. These are the words of R. Meir. The sages say, \"Only that village is forbidden. A market-place that is inside of a village is forbidden. If it is outside of the village, it is permitted. As for the nobility [?] of a village, it is forbidden to deal with them outside the village, but it is permitted inside the village. The shops that are crowned at each place are forbidden. If a man is in a caravan going from place to place and enters a village in which there is a market-place, let him not worry because it looks like he goes into an market-place. A market-place that was given by the kingdom, the state, or by the elite of the state are permitted. Only the market-place of idolaters is forbidden.   "
