Pirkei Avot

Chapter 1

Moshe received the Torah from Sinai and transmitted it to Yehoshua, and Yehoshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets transmitted it to the Men of the Great Assembly. They said three things: Be deliberate in judgment, raise up many disciples and make a fence for the Torah.












He [Rabbi Hillel] used to say: If I am not for me, who will be for me?  And when I am for myself alone, what am I? And if not now, then when?

Chapter 2



Chapter 3

Akavia ben Mahalalel says: Keep your eye on three things, and you will not come into the grip of sin: Know from where you came, and to where you are going, and before Whom you are destined to give an account and a reckoning. From where did you come? From a putrid drop. And to where are you going? To a place of dust, worms, and maggots. And before Whom are you destined to give an account and a reckoning? Before the King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He.
Rabbi Chanina, the Deputy High Priest, says: Pray for the welfare of the government, for were it not for the fear of it, man would swallow his fellow alive. Rabbi Chananya ben Teradyon says: Two who are sitting together and there are no words of Torah [spoken] between them, this is a session of scorners, as it is said (in Psalm 1:1): “[Happy is the man who has] not . . . sat in the session of the scorners.” But two who are sitting together and there are words of Torah [spoken] between them, the Divine Presence rests with them, as it is said (in Malachi 3:16): “Then those who feared the Lord spoke one with another, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for those who feared the Lord and for those who thought upon His Name.” I have no [Scriptural support for this] except [in a case of] two. From where [is there proof that] that even [when there is only] one [person studying Torah], the Holy One, Blessed be He, determines a reward for him? As it is said (in Lamentations 3:28): “He sits alone and is silent, since he takes [a reward] for it.”
Rabbi Shimon says: Three who ate at one table and did not say upon it words of Torah - it is as if they ate from the offerings of corpses, as it is said (quoting Isaiah 28:8): "For all of the tables are full of vomit and feces without the Omnipresent." However, three who ate at one table and said upon it words of Torah - it is as if they ate from the table of the Omnipresent, blessed be He, as it is said (quoting Ezekiel 41:22): "And he said to me, this is the table that is before Hashem."
Rabbi Chananya the son of Chakhinai says: He who stays awake at night, and who wanders on a solitary road, and who empties his heart for folly, this one is liable for [forfeiture of] his life.
Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah says: Anyone who accepts the yoke of Torah upon himself, they lift from him the yoke of government and the yoke of livelihood. And anyone who casts from himself the yoke of Torah, they place upon him the yoke of government and the yoke of livelihood.
Rabbi Chalafta [ben Dosa] of Kfar Chananiah says: Ten who are sitting together and engaging in Torah, the Divine Presence rests among them, as it is said (in Psalm 82:1): “God stands in the congregation of God.” From where [is there proof that this is true] even [when there are only] five? As it is said (in Amos 9:6): “And He has founded His band upon the earth.” From where even [when there are only] three? As it is said (in Psalm 82:1): “In the midst of judges He judges.” And from where even two? As it is said (in Malachi 3:16): “Then those who feared the Lord spoke one with another, and the Lord hearkened and heard.”  And from where even one? As it is said (in Exodus 20:20 (20:21 in NJPS)): “In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you.”
Rabbi Elazar, man of Bartuta, says: Give Him from what is His, for you and yours are His, and thus by David he says, "For all comes from Thee, and from Your hand we have given Thee" (I Chronicles 29:14). Rabbi Shimon says: He who is walking on the way and repeating his studies, and interrupts his studies and says, 'How lovely is this tree! And how lovely is this newly plowed field!' - Scripture considers him as if he is liable for [forfeiture of] his life.
Rabbi Dostai son of Rabbi Yannai in the name of Rabbi Meir says: Anyone who forgets one matter from his studies - Scripture considers him as if he is liable for [forfeiture of] his life, as it is said (Deuteronomy 4:9) "Only guard thyself, and guard thy life diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw." One could [suppose this statement applies to] even one whose studies have overpowered him, therefore, the verse says, "and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life" - he is not liable for [forfeiture of] his life until he sits down and [intentionally] removes them from his mind.
Rabbi Chanina son of Dosa says: Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom endures. And anyone whose wisdom precedes his fear of sin, his wisdom does not endure.  He would [also] say: Anyone whose actions are more plentiful than his wisdom, his wisdom endures. And anyone whose wisdom is more plentiful than his actions, his wisdom does not endure.
He would say: Anyone from whom the spirit of creations receive pleasure, from him the spirit of God finds pleasure. And anyone from whom the spirit of creations do not receive pleasure, from him the spirit of God does not find pleasure. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinus says: Late morning sleep, midday wine, chatter of children, and sitting in the assembly houses of the <i>Am Ha'aretz</i> [those who are lax in observing tithes and purity laws] remove a person from the world.
Rabbi Elazar of Modi'in says: One who profanes the <i>Kodeshim</i> [sacred material], and desecrates the holidays, and whitens [embarrasses] the face of another in public, and nullifies the covenant of Abraham our father, peace be upon him, and reveals meanings in the Torah that run contrary to the law, even though he has Torah knowledge and good deeds, he has no share in the world to come.
Rabbi Yishmael says: Be yielding to an elder, pleasant to a youth and greet all of mankind with joy.
Rabbi Akiva says: Joking and lightheartedness acclimate toward promiscuity. Tradition is a safeguarding fence around Torah. Tithes are a safeguarding fence around wealth. Vows are a safeguarding fence around abstinence. The safeguarding fence around wisdom: silence.
He would say: Beloved is humankind, since it is created in the image [of God]. A deeper love - it is revealed to him that he is created in the image, as it says (Genesis 9:6) "for in God's image He made humankind." Beloved are Israel, since they are called children of God. A deeper love - it is revealed to them that they are called children to God, as it says (Deuteronomy 14:1) "You are children of the Lord your God." Beloved are Israel, since a precious instrument has been given to them. A deeper love - it is revealed to them that the precious instrument of the world's creation has been given to them, as it says (Proverbs 4:2) "For a good lesson I have given to you; do not forsake my teaching."
Everything is foreseen, and freewill is given, and with goodness the world is judged. And all is in accordance to the majority of the deed.
He would say: Everything is given as collateral, and a net is cast over all of life. The shop is open, and the shopkeeper grants credit, and the accounting ledger is open, and the hand writes, and everyone who wants to borrow can come and borrow, and the collectors go constantly on their daily rounds and exact payment from man - with or without consent, and they have that upon which to rely, and the judgement is true judgement, and everything is prepared for the feast.
Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says: If there is no Torah, there is no worldly occupation; if there is no worldly occupation, there is no Torah. If there is no wisdom, there is no fear; if there is no fear, there is no wisdom. If there is no understanding, there is no knowledge; if there is no knowledge, there is no understanding.  If there is no flour, there is no Torah; if there is no Torah, there is no flour. He would say: Anyone whose wisdom exceeds his deeds, to what is he compared? To a tree whose branches are many but whose roots are few; then the winds comes and uproots it and turns it upside down; as it is said; "And he shall be like a lonely juniper tree in the wasteland and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places of the wilderness, a salty land that is uninhabitable." [Jeremiah 17:6].  But one whose deeds exceed his wisdom, what is he like? Like a tree whose branches are few but whose roots are many; since even if all the winds of the world come and blow upon it, they do not move it from its place, as it is said; "He shall be like a tree planted by the waters, and spreads out its roots by the river, and shall not perceive when heat comes, but its leaf shall remain fresh; and it will not be troubled in the year of drought, nor will it cease to bear fruit." [Jeremiah 17:8].
Rabbi Eliezer ben Chisma says: the laws of <i>Kinin</i> [bird offerings] and <i>Niddah</i> [menstruation], these are the body of the laws. Astronomical calculations and <i>Gematria</i> [numerical calculations] are the condiments to wisdom.

Chapter 4

Ben Zoma says: Who is the wise one? He who learns from all men, as it says, "I have acquired understanding from all my teachers" (Psalms 119:99). Who is the mighty one? He who conquers his desire, as it says, "slowness to anger is better than a mighty person and the ruler of his spirit than the conqueror of a city." (Proverbs 16:32). Who is the rich one? He who is happy with his lot, as it says, "When you eat [from] the work of your hands, you will be happy, and it will be well with you" (Psalms 128:2). "You will be happy" in this world, and "it will be well with you" in the world to come. Who is honored? He who honors the created beings, as it says, "For those who honor Me, I will honor; and those who despise me will be held in little esteem" (I Samuel 2:30).
Ben Azai says: Run to do an easy commandment as to a difficult one, and flee from sin; since a commandment leads to another commandment, and a sin leads to another sin; since the reward for a commandment is another commandment, and the reward for a sin is another sin.
He would say: Do not disparage anyone, and do not shun any thing. For you have no man who does not have his hour, and you have no thing that does not have a place.
Rabbi Levitas, a man of Yavneh, says: Be very, very humble in spirit, for the hope of man is worms. Rabbi Yochanan son of Berukah says: Whoever desecrates the Name of Heaven secretly, they punish him publicly. There is no differentiation between intentional and unintentional when it comes to desecration of the Name.
Rabbi Yishmael his son says: One who studies Torah in order to teach will be given the opportunity to both study and to teach. One who studies in order to practice will be given the opportunity to study, to teach, to observe, and to practice. Rabbi Tzadok says: Do not make it [the Torah] into a crown with which to aggrandize yourself, and not into a spade with which to dig into them. And thus Hillel used to say: And one who makes use of the crown [of learning] passes away. Which infers that any one who benefits from the words of the Torah removes his life from the world.
Rabbi Yosi says: Anyone who honors the Torah - his body will be honored by the created beings. Anyone who desecrates the Torah - his body will be desecrated by the created beings.
Rabbi Yishmael, his son, says: One who withholds himself from judging - they remove from him enmity, theft, and the false oath. One whose mind is arrogant in teaching is an imbecile, wicked, and arrogant in spirit.
He would say: Do not judge alone, for there is no lone judge aside from One [God]. And do not say,"Accept my opinion," for they are permitted and not you.
Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who implements the Torah in poverty, his end will be to implement it in wealth. And anyone that disregards the Torah because of wealth, his end will be to disregard it because of poverty.
Rabbi Meir says: Minimize business and engage in Torah. Be humble of spirit before everyone. If you neglect the Torah, many reasons for neglecting it will be presented to you. And if you labor in Torah, He [God] has abundant reward to grant you.
Rabbi Eliezer son of Yaakov says: One who does a single commandment acquires a single defender. One who does a single sin acquires a single prosecutor. Repentance and good deeds are like a shield against punishment. Rabbi Yochanan the shoemaker says: Every gathering that is for the sake of Heaven, its end is to endure. And every gathering that is not for the sake of Heven, its end is not to endure.
Rabbi Elazar son of Shamua says: Let the honor of your students be dear to you as your own, and the honor of your fellow like the reverence of your teacher, and the reverence of your teacher like the reverence of Heaven.
Rabbi Yehuda says: Be careful in study, for an error in study is considered an intentional transgression. Rabbi Shimon says: There are three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood and the crown of monarchy - but the crown of a good name outweighs them all.
Rabbi Nehorai says: Exile yourself to a place of Torah, and do not say that it will follow after you, that your colleagues will make it yours. Do not rely on your understanding.
Rabbi Yanai says: We do not have [the ability to explain] the success of the wicked or even the suffering of the righteous. Rabbi Mattia son of Charash says: Be the first to greet every person, and be a tail to lions, and do not be a head to foxes.
Rabbi Yaakov says: This world is like a hallway before the world to come. Fix yourself in the hallway so you may enter the drawing room.
He would say: One hour of repentance and good deeds in this world is better than all the time in the world to come. And one hour of pleasure in the world to come is better than all the time in this world.
Rabbi Shimon the son of Elazar says: Do not try to assuage the anger of your friend at the time of his anger; do not try to comfort him at the time when his deceased lies before him; do not question him at the time of his vow; and do not seek to see him at the time of his humiliation.
Shmuel the Younger says: (Proverbs 24:17-18) "When your enemy falls, do not be happy, and when he stumbles, let your heart not rejoice. Lest God see and it be bad in His eyes and He turn from him [the enemy] His anger."
Elisha ben Abuya says: One who learns as a child is compared to what? To ink written on new parchment. And one who learns as an elder is compared to what? To ink written on scraped parchment. Rabbi Yose bar Yehuda, man of the town of the Babylonian, says: One who learns from young ones is compared to what? To one who eats unripe grapes and drinks wine from its press. And one who learns from elders is compared to what? To one who eats ripe grapes and drinks aged wine. Rabbi says: Do not look at the jug but rather at what is in it. For there are new jugs full of old, and old that do not have even new within them.
Rabbi Elazar HaKapor says: Envy, lust and honor drive a man from the world.
He would say: Those that are born will die, and those that are dead will live [again], and the living will be judged. [It is necessary] to know, to make known, and to become conscious that He is God, He is the Maker, He is the Creator, He is the Understander, He is the Judge, He is the Witness, He is the Litigant, and He is destined to judge. Blessed Be He, who has before Him no wrong, no forgetfulness, no respect of persons, no taking of bribes, for all is His. And know that everything is according to the reckoning. And do not let yourself count on the netherworld being a place of refuge for you, because against your will you were created, and against your will you were born, and against your will you live, and against your will you die, and against your will you are destined to give account and reckoning before the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be he.

Chapter 5



Chapter 6

Rabbi Meir says: Anyone who involves himself in Torah for its own sake merits many things, and moreover the entire world is worthwhile for his sake;  He is called "friend," "beloved," "lover of the Ominpresent," "lover of [all] creatures," "delighter of the Ominpresent," "delighter of [all] creatures;"  He is clothed in humility and reverence, and it prepares him to be righteous, devout, upright and trustworthy, and it distances him from sin, and draws him near to merit;  We enjoy from him counsel and comprehension, understanding and strength, as it is said (Proverbs 8:14): "Mine is counsel and comprehension, I am understanding, mine is strength;"  It gives him kingship and dominion, and [the ability to] investigate in judgement, and the secrets of the Torah are revealed to him, and he becomes like an ever-strengthening spring, and like a river that does not stop;  He is modest and long-tempered, and forgives insult to him;  And it enlarges him and raises him above all [that God] made.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:  Each and every day a heavenly echo goes out from Mount Horeb, and announces and says: "Woe to the creatures for disparaging the Torah;"  for anyone who does not involve himself in the Torah is called "rebuked," as it is said (Proverbs 11:22): "A ring of gold in a swine's snout is a beautiful woman who turns from discretion," and it says (Exodus 32:16): "And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tablets," do not read "graven" (harut) but rather "freedom" (herut), for there is no free man except one that involves himself in Torah learning;  And anyone who involves himself in Torah learning is elevated, as it is said (Numbers 21:19): "and from Mattanah, Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel, Bamoth."
One who learns from his fellow one chapter or one law or one verse or one utterance {/thing?} or even one letter must treat him with honor, and we found it to be thus with David King of Israel, who learned from Ahithophel two things alone, [yet] called him his teacher, his guide, and his close friend{ lit. "familiar"}, as it is said (Psalms 55:14) "But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and my close friend." And if David, King of Israel, who only learned from Ahithophel two things called him his teacher, his guide, and his friend, how much more must one who learns from his fellow one chapter or one law or one verse or one one utterance or one letter treat his friend with an honor many times greater. And there is no honor except Torah, as it is said (Proverbs 3: 35) "The wise shall inherit honor", and "the whole-hearted shall inherit good" (28: 10), and there is no good except Torah as it is said (Proverbs 4:2) "I give you good doctrine, do not forsake my Torah".
This is the way [to toil in] Torah: eat bread with salt and drink a small amount of water and sleep on the ground and live a life [whose conditions will cause you] sorrow and in Torah you toil; if you do so (Psalms 128: 2) "happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee". Happy shalt though be in this world, and iy shall be well with thee in the world to come.
Do not ask for glory for yourself, and do not covet honour. More than just studying, act. And do not lust after the tables of kings since your table is greater than theirs and your crown is greater than theirs. And your employer is faithful; he will pay you the wages of your labour.
Greater is Torah than priesthood and kingship, for monarchy is obtained with thirty levels, and priesthood with twenty-four, and Torah is obtained with forty-eight things. And they are these: learning, listening of the ear, preparation of speech, understanding of the heart, reverence, awe, humility, happiness, purity, service of Sages, care in [selection of] friends, debate of the students, clarification, reading, learning, minimal commodities, minimal worldly occupation, minimal pleasure, minimal sleep, minimal conversation, minimal laughter, patience, generosity, trust in Sages, acceptance of suffering, knowing one's place, gladness in one's portion, erection of a fence to his words, lack of self-aggrandizement, lovableness, love of God, love of the creatures, love of the righteous, love of the upright, love of rebuke, distancing from honor, lack of arrogance in learning, lack of joy in teaching, lifting of a burden with one's friend, judgement with the benefit of the doubt, standing for the truth, standing for peace, deliberation in study, questioning and responding, hearing and adding, learning in order to teach and learning in order to act, making his master wiser, focusing one's words, citing the source, for it is taught that one who cites a source brings redemption to the world, as it says (Esther 2:22): "Esther told the king in Mordekhai’s name."
Great is Torah, for it gives life to those who do it in this world and in the next world, as it says: 'For they are life to those that find them, and healing to all his flesh' (Proverbs 4:22), and it says 'It will be healing for your navel, and tonic to your bones' (Proverbs 3:8). And it says 'It is a tree of life to those who hold it, and those who grasp it are happy' (Proverbs 3:18). And it says 'For they are an accompaniment of grace for your head, and a necklace for your  throat' (Proverbs 1:9). And it says 'She will give your head an accompaniment of grace; with a crown of glory she will protect you' (Proverbs 4:9). And it says 'For by me your days will be multiplied, and you will be given additional years of life' (Proverbs 9:11). And it says 'Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left is wealth and honor' (Proverbs 3:16), and it says 'For length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you' (Proverbs 3:2), and it says 'her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace' (Proverbs 3: 17).
Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, says: beauty, strength, riches, honor, wisdom, maturity, hoary head, and children are fitting for the righteous and fitting for the world, as it is written: "The hoary head is a crown of glory, it will be found in the way of righteousness" (Proverbs 16:31). And it says (Proverbs 20:29), "The glory of young men is their strength; and the beauty of old men is the hoary head." And it says (Proverbs 14:24), "The crown of the wise is their wealth." And it says (Proverbs 17:6), "Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers." And it says (Isaiah 24:23), "Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the Lord of hosts will reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be Glory." Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: These seven qualities enumerated by the sages about the righteous were all fulfilled in Rebbi (Yehuda haNasi) and his sons. 
Said Rabbi Yosi ben Kisma: One time I was walking on the road, and a man met me, and greeted me, and I returned the greeting. He said to me, "My master, from which place are you?" I said to him, "I am from a great city of Sages and scribes." He said to me, "My master, do you wish to live among us in our place, and I would give you thousands of thousand golden <i>Dinarim</i> [specific unit of money], and precious stones and pearls?" I said to him, "If you were to give me all the silver, gold, precious stones and pearls in the world, I would not live but in a place of Torah." And so it is written in the book of Psalms by David, King of Israel (Psalms 119:72), "The law of Thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver." Moreover, at the time of a person's passing, neither silver, gold, nor precious stones or pearls accompany him, but Torah and good deeds alone, as it says (Proverbs 6:22), "When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, When thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall be your conversation"; "When thou walkest, it shall lead thee" - in this world; "When thou liest down, it shall watch over thee" - in the grave; "and when thou awakest, it shall be your conversation" - for the world to come. And it says (Haggai 2:8), "Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, saith the Lord of hosts."
Five possessions has the Holy One, Blessed be He, declared His own in His world, And they are: The Torah [is] one possession, Heaven and earth [are] one possession, Abraham [is] one possession, Israel [is] one possession, [And] the Sanctuary [is] one possession.  From where [do we infer that] the Torah [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, the first of His of old.” (Proverbs 8:22.)  From where [do we infer that] heaven and earth [are] one possession? For it is written: “Thus says the Lord: ‘The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. Which house might you build for Me? And which place might be My resting-place?’” (Isaiah 66:1), And it [also] says: “How manifold are Your works, O Lord! In wisdom have You made them all; full is the earth, Your possession.” (Psalm 104:24.)  From where [do we infer that] Abraham [is] one possession? For it is written: “And [Melchizedek] blessed him, and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth.’” (Genesis 14:19.)  From where [do we infer that] Israel [is] one possession? For it is written: “Till Your people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over whom You have made Your own” (Exodus 15:16), And it [also] says: “As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all My delight.” (Psalm 16:3.)  From where [do we infer that] the Sanctuary [is] one possession? For it is written: “The Sanctuary, O Lord, that Your hands have established” (Exodus 15:17), And it is [also] said: “And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain, which His right hand had possessed.” (Psalm 78:54.)
Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in this world, He created only for His glory, as it says (Isaiah 43:7): "Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him." And it also says (Exodus 15:18 ), "The LORD shall reign for ever and ever." 
(Makkot 3:16) Rabbi  Chananya ben Akashia says, The Holy One, Blessed be He, wanted to give Israel merit; therefore He multiplied for them Torah and commandments, as it is written, "The Lord desired, for the sake of his righteousness, to make the Torah great and glorious," (Isaiah 42:21).
