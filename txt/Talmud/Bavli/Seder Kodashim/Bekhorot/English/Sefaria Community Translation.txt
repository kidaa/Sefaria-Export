Daf 9b









With whom does the Mishnah accord?
It is R. Judah, as it is taught
The first-born of a donkey is prohibited in benefit. But R. Shimon permits. 







































Rabbah said:
R. Shimon agrees that after its neck is broken it is prohibited to derive benefit from it.
What is his reasoning? He derives "breaking its neck" from "breaking its neck" connected to the heifer whose neck is broken.
