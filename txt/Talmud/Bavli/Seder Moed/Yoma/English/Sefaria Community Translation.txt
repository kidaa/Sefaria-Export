Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a






It is taught elsewhere:
Seven days before the burning of the [red] calf, they would separate the priest who was to burn the calf from his house [and bring him] to the chamber overlooking the [Temple] building from the northeast, and it was called the 'Chamber of the House of Stone.'
And why was it called 'Chamber of the House of Stone'? Because all of its work (ie. the work done inside) was with Manure vessels, Stone vessels, and Earthenware vessels [all three of which cannot contract impurity].
What is the reason for this?
Because a Tevul Yom is purified through the calf, as it is taught,

On Yom Kippur it is prohibited to eat, drink, wash oneself, lathe oneself, wear leather sandals (shoes), or marital relations. And the King and the Bride may wash their faces and a new mother may wear shoes. These are the words of R. Eliezer. But the Sages prohibit this.

Daf 74a



Daf 74b









(Leviticus 16, 29) "You shall afflict your souls". Perhaps one should sit in the heat or in the cold in order to be in pain. Therefore the verse taught (Leviticus 16, 29) "And all the work you shall not perform"
Just as one refrains from work and does not perform, so too affliction one refrains but does not perform.

Come and hear [a proof]: That which Rabbah bar Shmuel taught, 
"'We feed a pregnant woman [on Yom Kippur] who [has a craving because she] smelled [it] until she returns to [herself]; and we feed someone bitten by a mad dog from the lobe of its liver; and we apply medication to someone who has pain in his mouth on Shabbat' - these are the words of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yosse in the name of Rabbi Matya ben Charash.
And the Sages say, 
'With this [we agree] but not with the other.'"
To which [one] does "with this" refer?
If I will say [it refers] to the pregnant woman, it is obvious.
Is there anyone who says that a pregnant woman is not [given to eat]?
Rather, is it not [referring] to the medication? [Hence,] we hear from it [that we can apply medication to a pain in the mouth on Shabbat].
Rav Ashi said, 
"Our mishna is also exact [in indicating this through a close reading], 'And Rabbi ben Matya ben Charash also said, "we apply medication to someone who has pain in his mouth on Shabbat"' and the Sages do not disagree about it.
And if it was that the Sages disagreed about it, let [the cases] be mixed [and there would have been no reason to differentiate this case from the other ones by the phrase, 'also said'] and let them be taught [together] and let the rabbis disagree [with all of them] at the end." We hear from this [conclusively that the proposition is correct.
"Because of possible danger to his life, etc."
Why does it then need to say, "and when there is a doubt about [the saving of] lives, it supersedes [the observance of] Shabbat?"
Rav Yehudah said that Rav said,
"Not only about the doubt on this Shabbat did they say [there is sufficient reason to violate the Shabbat], but rather even concerning the doubt on another Shabbat."
How is this?
For example, they evaluated him [to require a doseage] for eight days and the first day [of the treatment] was Shabbat.
What is it that you would say [in opposition were it not for this inference]?
Let him wait until the evening, so that we do not desecrate the Shabbat twice because of  him. We infer [however, that such is not the case].
We also taught [similarly to this understanding in an early authoritative statement],
"We heat up hot water for a sick person on Shabbat, whether it is to give him to drink or whether it is to give him health (to bathe him).
And not only on this Shabbat did they say [this], but rather [also] regarding another Shabbat.
And we do not say,
'Let us wait in case he becomes healthy,' but rather we heat it up immediately, since a doubt about [the saving of] lives supersedes [the observance of] Shabbat. And not just a doubt on this Shabbat, but rather even a doubt on another Shabbat.
And we do not do these things by the agency of gentiles nor by the agency of Cuthites, but rather by the agency of prominent Jews.
And we do not say to do these things based on the [opinion] of women nor on the [opinion] of Cuthites, but we do combine them to a differing (minority) opinion."
Our rabbis taught, 
"We engage in the saving of lives on Shabbat, and the one who shows alacrity [in this] is praiseworthy and we do not need to get permission from the court [to do so].
How is this? 
If he saw an infant fall into the sea, he spreads out a net and brings him up, 
and the one who shows alacrity [in this] is praiseworthy and we do not need to get permission from the court [to do so]" - and even though he traps fish.
"If he saw an infant fall into a pit, he uproots its [wall's] section[s] and brings him up, 
and the one who shows alacrity [in this] is praiseworthy and we do not need to get permission from the court [to do so]" - and even though he builds a step.
"If he saw that a door was locked in front of an infant, he breaks it and brings him out, and the one who shows alacrity [in this] is praiseworthy and we do not need to get permission from the court [to do so]" - and even though he has in mind to break it into [usable pieces].
"We extinguish and make a separation line [of water] in front of a fire on Shabbat, and the one who shows alacrity [in this] is praiseworthy and we do not need to get permission from the court [to do so]" - and even though he brings down [the flames and produces coals].
And it is necessary [to inform us of all these cases]. Since if we had been informed about the [case of the] sea, [we would think] it is because, by and by, [the infant] would go away [and be lost], but [in the case of the] pit, where he is sitting [in one place], I would say no. [Hence] it is necessary. 
And if we would have been informed about [the case of the] pit, [we would think] it is because he would panic, but [in the case of the] door being locked, it is possible for [the adult trying to save him] to sit on [the other] side of the door and sway him with [the sound of] nuts [in order to calm him. Hence] it is necessary. 
"We extinguish and make a separation line" - why do I [need to know this, since it would be obvious, given that the saving of lives is involved]? 
[To tell me] that even in a different courtyard [may you do this].
Rav Yosef said that Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said,
"We do not go after the majority concerning the saving of lives."
How is this?
If we will say that there are nine Jews and one Cuthite among them [and we are not sure which one of the ten is covered under a pile of stones and in danger of death], the majority are Jews; 
(but rather) [if they were] half and half, we [already know that we] are lenient in the case of a doubt regarding the saving of a life. 
But rather that there are nine Cuthites and one Jew. This is also obvious, as they are fixed, and all fixed items [about which I have a doubt as to the identity of one of them] are [considered] like they are half and half (there is an equal chance of it belonging to one group as to the other, even though one is more numerous).
No, it is necessary [in a case of] a different courtyard. What is it that you would say [in opposition were it not for this inference]?
Anything [the identity of which is in doubt] that is removed [from its place and not fixed] is [considered] to have been [part of] the majority. We infer [however,] that we do not go after [such a] majority concerning the saving of lives.
But that is not so!
And was it not that Rav Assi said that Rabbi Yochanan said,
 "If there are nine Cuthites and one Jew in the same courtyard, we act to save the life [of an unidentified member of the ten] , if they are in a different courtyard, we do not act to save him."
That is not a difficulty. [Our case is] that they have all been removed; [the case just presented is] that only some of them have been removed. 
And did Shmuel say this?
And was it not taught,
"[If] one found an abandoned child [in the city]: If most [of the residents] are Cuthites, it is a Cuthite; and if most are Jews it is a Jew; [and if] it is half and half it is a Jew."
And Rav said,
"They only learned this regarding sustaining it, but not regarding its pedigree."

Daf 86b










And yet, Reish Lakish said:
Repentance is great, for intentional sins are made for him into virtues, as it says (Ezekiel 33:19), "And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby."




Rabbi Yitzhak said: "They said in the West in the name of Rabbah, son of Mari:
'Come and see that God's character is not like that of (a person of) flesh and blood.  
This is the character of (a person of) flesh and blood: If one mocks his fellow with words, it is doubtful whether that person can be appeased by him or not.  And even if you say he can be appeased, it is doubtful whether he can be appeased merely with words or not.  
But God, if a man commits a transgression in secret, is appeased by him merely with words.  As it is said: "Take with you words, and return to the Lord." (Hosea 14:3) And not only that, God considers a good deed! As it is said: "Accept that which is good." (ibid.) And not only that, Scripture exalts him as if he had sacrificed bulls.  As it is said: "We will offer the bulls of our lips." (ibid.)
In case you say that bulls are obligatory, Scripture says: "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely." (Hosea 14:5)




















Our Rabbis taught:
Sins that one confessed on this Yom Kippur, s/he should not confess to them on another Yom Kippur, but if s/he repeated them s/he should confess to them on another Yom Kippur. If one does not repeat them and confesses again, scripture says about that person (Proverbs 26:11) "As a dog that returneth to his vomit, So is a fool that repeateth his folly."
Rabbi Eliezer Ben Yakov says
All the more so that s/he is praiseworthy, as it says, (Psalms 51:5) "For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me."
So how do I associate "As a dog that returneth do his vomit?" According to Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says,
Once a person commits a sin and repeats it, it is permitted to them.
Do you really believe that it is permitted to them?
Rather, I will say
it is made for them as if it is permitted

Daf 87a


























[Transgressions between a person and God, etc.]...
Rav Yosef, son of Havu, pointed out the following contradiction to Rabbi Abahu:
(Yom Kippur atones for transgressions between a person and God, but for) transgressions against one's neighbor, Yom Kippur cannot atone (until he appeases his neighbor).
Isn't it also written: "If one person sins against another, God will mediate for him."? (1 Samuel 2:25)
Who is God (in this scenario)? The judge.
If so, how do we understand the end of that verse?
"But if a person sins against God, who will mediate for him?"
What he means to say is:
If a person sins against another person, God will mediate for him and his fellow will forgive him. But if a person sins against God, who will mediate for him? Only repentance and good deeds.
Rabbi Yitzhak said:
"One who angers his fellow, even merely through words, must appease him.  As it is said: 'My son, if you take a pledge for your neighbor, if you clasp hands for a stranger, you are ensnared by the words of your mouth.  Do this now, my son, and be saved, since you are at another's mercy: Go! Humble yourself and beg your neighbor.' (Proverbs 6:1-3)"
If you have financial means, open the palm of your hand to him (i.e. pay him).  And if not, gather many others around him.
Rav Hisda said:
"It is necessary to appease him with three rows of three people (each).  As it is said: 'He comes before men and says, "I have sinned and perverted that which is right, and it has not profited me.' (Job 33:27)"
Rabbi Yossi, son of Hanina, said:
"One who begs a favor of his fellow should not ask it of him more than three times.  As it is said: 'Please, forgive please...and now please forgive.'  (Genesis 50:17)" And if he [against whom he had sinned] has died, he should bring ten people and stand them around his grave and say:
"I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and against so-and-so whom I have injured."
Rabbi Abba once had a grievance with Rabbi Yirmiyah.  He (Rabbi Yirmiyah) went and sat down at Rabbi Abba's door.  
When the maid pour out water, some drops touched his head.  
He said:
"They have made me like a dung-heap!" He recited this passage about himself: "He raises the need from the dung-heaps." (Psalms 113:7)
Rabbi Abba heard and went out to face him and said to him: 
"Now, I must come forth to appease you! As it is written: 'Go, humble yourself and beg your neighbor.'" (Proverbs 6:3)
When Rabbi Zeira had a grievance against a certain person, he would pass by them repeatedly and show  that he was willing to reconcile, so that they would come out and appease him.  
Rav once had a grievance with a certain butcher.  The butcher did not come before him (to reconcile).  
On the eve of Yom Kippur he (Rav) said:
"I will go to appease him."
Rav Huna met him
and asked him: "Where are you going, Master?"
He said: "To appease so-and-so."
He (Rav Huna) said (to himself):
"Abba is about to cause one's someone's death."  Rav came and stood over the butcher, who was sitting and chopping (an animal's) head.  He raised his eyes and said to him:
"You're Abba!?
I have no grievance with you." (Also possibly: "I will have nothing to do with you.")
While he was chopping the head, a bone flew off, struck him in the throat, and killed him.  
Once Rav was expounding upon a Biblical text before the Rabbis, and there entered

Daf 87b

Rabbi Hiyya.  Rav returned to the beginning (and began again).  Bar Kapara entered.  Rav returned to the beginning (and began again).  
Rabbi Shimon, the son of Rabbi, entered.  Rav returned to the beginning (and began again).
Rabbi Hanina, the son of Hama, entered.  Rav said:
"All this continually going back! Let's go!!"
He did not return (to the beginning).  
Rabbi Hanina was angry.  Rav went to him on thirteen eves of Yom Kippur, but could not appease him.
But how could Rav do so?
Didn't Rabbi Yosi, the son of Hanina, say:
"One who requests a favor from his fellow should not request it from him more than three times."?
Rav is different.
And how could Rabbi Hanina do so? (withholding forgiveness)
Didn't Rabba say:
"One who overlooks his own principles/character traits, all his transgressions are overlooked."?
Rather, Rabbi Hanina had seen in a dream that Rav was being hanged from a date tree.  And everyone knows that one who is hanged from a date tree (in a dream) will become head (of an Academy).  
He (Rabbi Hanina) said (to himself):
"Derive from it that authority will be given to him."
And so he would not be appeased, so that (Rav) would go to teach Torah in Babylon.
