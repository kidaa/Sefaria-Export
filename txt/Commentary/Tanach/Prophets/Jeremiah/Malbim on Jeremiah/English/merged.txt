Malbim on Jeremiah

Chapter 1



Verse 1



Verse 2



Verse 3



Verse 4



Verse 5



Verse 6


I cannot speak, for I am a child. This was for three reasons: 1. That the child (Jeremiah) did not have confidence in himself in front of greater people, 2. That the child did not know how to order his words in the correct way (meaning he did not know how to speak well in front of the congregation), and 3. That maybe the nation will become angry with what he says and come upon him and kill him.
