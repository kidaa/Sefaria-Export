The darkness increased until no one could see another person, so no two people partnered together due to the great difficulty, as the verse says "no one saw their brother."  This s the result: when I do not feel the pain of my friend, I dull my senses--as the verse says "no one was able to arise from under it" which means that there is no overcoming it.
