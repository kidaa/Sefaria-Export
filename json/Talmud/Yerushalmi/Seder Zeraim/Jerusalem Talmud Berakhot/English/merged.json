            "From when may one recite Shema in the evening? From the time the Kohanim go in to eat their Terumah [produce consecrated for priestly consumption], to the end of the first watch, says Rabbi Eliezer. And the Sages say: Until midnight. Rabban Gamliel says: Until the break of dawn. It once happened that his [Rabban Gamliel’s] sons came from a house of feasting. They said to him: We have not recited Shema. He to them: If dawn has not broken, you are obligated to recite it. [This is true] Not only in this case; saying, in all cases where the Sages said [some precepts can be performed] only until midnight — their obligations remain until the break of dawn. [e.g.] Burning the fats and limbs [of the sacrifices, on the Temple altar] — those precepts [can be performed] until the break of dawn. [e.g.:] All [sacrifices] which may be eaten for one day — their precepts [of eating them can be performed] until the break of dawn. If that is so, why did the Sages say, \"until midnight\"? To distance a person from transgression.",

            "...He teaches, one should not stand up to pray from within talk, laughter or levity and not amidst empty things, rather from within words of Torah. So too one should not take leave of their friend through talk, laughter or levity and not through empty things, but rather from within words of Torah. So we find among the first prophets who would seal their word with words of praise on consolation. R’ Elazar said ‘except Yirmeyahu who finished with words of rebuke. R’ Yochanan replied to him, he too sealed his word with words of consolation “…so shall Babylon sink and not rise…” (Yirmeyahu 51:64). Since Yirmeyahu goes back and prophecies on the destruction of the Holy Temple, perhaps he sealed his words with the destruction? That is why the verse continues “Until here are the words of Jeremiah,” (ibid.) - he sealed his words with the fall of those who destroyed it. And no one sealed their words with rebuke?! Isn’t it written, “…and they shall be an abhorring for all flesh.” (Yeshayahu 66:24)? That is dealing with the idolators. Isn’t it written, “For you have utterly rejected us…” (Eicha 5:22)? "

R’ Achva bar R’ Zeira said they were occupied with the reading of shema, this is what it says “and you shall speak of them…” (Devarim 6:7) R’ Yodah ben Pazi said they were occupied with the creation of the world, this is what it says “By the word of the Lord, the heavens were made…” (Tehillim 33:6) R’ Yodan b’rei R’ Ibo said they were occupied with the consolation of Jerusalem as it says “…speak to the heart of Jerusalem…” (Yeshayahu 40:2)The Rabbis said that they were occupied with the matter of the chariot, this is what it says “…and behold a fiery chariot and fiery horses…” (Melachim II 2:11)…"
