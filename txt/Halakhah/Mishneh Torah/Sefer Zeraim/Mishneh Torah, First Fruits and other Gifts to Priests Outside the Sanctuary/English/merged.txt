Mishneh Torah, First Fruits and other Gifts to Priests Outside the Sanctuary

Chapter 1

Twenty-four gifts were given to the Priests, and they are all explained in the Torah, and the covenant with Aharon includes all of them. And every Priest that does not recognize these gifts, he is not part of the Priestly tribe, and one must not give him any of these gifts.

Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Chapter 4



A proselyte brings and reads, as it is said to Abraham, "A father of the many peoples I have made you..." This means that he was the father to the entire world that entered under the wings of the Shechina, and the promise was to Abraham first that his children would inherit the land. So too, priests and levites bring and read because they have open cities.
