Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chayyim

Siman 1




Fewer supplication [said] with meaning, is more preferable than more [supplication] without meaning.

Siman 2



Siman 3

When one enters into the throne room (euphemism for bathroom stall), say: "התכבדו מכובדים, etc." (Berachot 60b).  But now we are not habituated to recite it.
One should be modest in the bathroom stall, and not reveal oneself until sitting.  <i>And two men shall not go together.  Also, one shouldn't talk there, and should lock the door for himself for the sake of modesty (Ohr Zarua).</i>
If one wishes to work about the anus with a pebble or a chip of wood in order to open up his rectum [i.e. he has trouble relieving himself], he should work about it before he sits but should not work about it after he sits, because [this exposes him to the] danger of witchcraft.
Only reveal yourself from behind a tephach, and in front two tephachs. But for a woman behind one tephach, and in front nothing.
If one defecates in an open place without any partitions, he should try to face south with his rear facing north, or vice versa. However, east to west is forbidden. <i>(With regards to urinating, any manner is allowed) (Beit Yosef in the name of Maimonides)</i>
Likewise, it is forbidden to sleep from west to east, if one's wife is with him. And it is proper to take care even when one's wife is not with him.
One who can passes water "from Scopus inwards" <i>(this refers to a place where the Temple Mount can be seen, and further away it can not be seen - Rashi)</i> should not sit facing the Holy, rather he should face north or south, or should keep the Holy to his side.
When one defecates in a field, if he is behind a fence he may defecate immediately. In an [open] valley, he should distance himself to the point where his friend can not see his disorderly state.
One should not sit [to defecate] in a rushed or forceful manner. And one should not force himself exceedingly, so that he might not rupture the anal sphincter.
One should not wipe with the right hand.
One should not wipe with earthenware due to a concern of witchcraft. Nor with dry grass, for one who wipes with something that is flammable can dislocate the anal sphincter. Nor with a stone that another wiped with, because this can bring a person to hemorrhoids. <i>Rema: And now, that our bathrooms are not in the field, people are accustomed to wipe (earthenware and likewise they are accustomed to wipe) with something flammable, and this is not harmful. And go out observe what people do (Chidushei Agudah, Chapter Hamotzei)</i>
One should relieve himself modestly at night, just as in the day.
One should not urinate from a standing position lest it sprinkle down upon his legs, if he is not on a high place, or relieving himself upon loose earth <i>(meaning, soil that is not virgin, but rather like plowed earth).</i>
Unless he is married, one should take care not to grasp the organ from the corona downwards and urinate, lest he bring forth seed in vain. However, it is a pious practice to take such care even if one is married.
It is permitted to aid [urination] from the testicles and below, even for one who is not married. 
 One who is married is not permitted to grasp the organ except to urinate. However, he is not to brush against it.
One who delays his cavities [from elimination] transgresses the commandment, "You shall not make yourselves loathsome."

Siman 4

One should rinse his hands and recite the benediction "concerning the taking of the hands".  <i>Rema: Some say to also recite "Who created...," and even if one did not use the facilities, and thus we behave (Abudraham).  Water that is invalid for hand-washing for a meal later on (chapter 160) may be legitimate for washing one's hands for prayer.  However, there is one who says that one should not recite a blessing upon such.</i>
Be careful to pour water on them three times in order to remove the evil spirit from them.
One should not touch his hands to his mouth, nose, ears, or eyes before washing.

Siman 5

One should concentrate in blessings of the meaning of the words.  When mentioning the name HASHEM, concentrate on the meaning of the recital being lordship that He is the Master of all, and concentrate on the Yud-Hei that Was, Is, and Will Be.  And when one mentions ELOHIM, concentrate on that He is Strength, Master of Wherewithal and Master of the powers of all.

Siman 6

when one leaves the washroom he will recite the benediction of "who creates man with wisdom", as the creation of man was done with  great wisdom. there are those who interpret this to mean, that the body is similar to a sack full of air, and is full of holes, as it (the opening of the sack) is close to the bottom. Others understand "with wisdom", that    G-d arranged the food of Adam Harishon [before he was created] and afterwards he was created. "and create in him holes, holes hollow places, hollow places", meaning: many holes, for example mouth nose and anus, and also creates in him limbs with many hollow places, like the heart, belly and intestines. "If one of them to shut up", meaning: that in the places there are holes there is one hole, Which is the mouth, that when [one is inside his mother] he is closed off [dependent on mother for all needs does not need to use organs] and [if] when he goes into the air of the world it [his organs]  remain clogged, it would not be possible to remain alive even for one moment. and in regard to the limbs with hollow places if one of them are open- it would not not be possible to remain alive for even one moment. Furthermore there is another interpretation, that man is able to not relieve himself (immediately) and not die, and since, and because past that limit- it is impossible to remain alive for even a moment. Since in general the limbs [made reference to in the benediction] are the anus and penis, and in regard to hollow places- if they were opened even for a moment it would be impossible to live- [making reference to the belly and intestines, it  good to praise on making fit what is needed in man. and another [interpretation] is possible that after he eats, waste comes out in a large amount [that he cant handle] he will die, implied [in the phrase] " if one of them are opened", also that phrase refers to that all his needs are done [using this system G-d created to sustain life i.e the human body].
There is to wait to make the blessing "on the taking of hands" until his coming to the synagogue, and he organizes it with the rest of the blessings. The descendants of the Sephardim  did not hold this way. In any instance, he should not make the blessing twice; and so to he that recites it in the home should not do so at synagogue, and he that recites it in the synagogue should not say at home (all of this in Siman 2). And he who learns before he enters the synagogue, or prays before, makes the blessing at home and should not recite it in the synagogue. Even in this case, there is to organize it with the other blessings in the synagogue and to not make in their homes (Maharil, Laws of Prayer).   
The blessing of my "my G-d, my soul" does not open with "blessed", because it is a blessing of thanks, and a blessings of thanks do not open with "blessed", like what we find with the blessing of the rain
There are those who have a custom, that after one has said the Morning Blessing and the others answered "Amen", one of those who answered ["Amen"] says "Amen" and says the  blessing, and they answer him with "Amen", and in this order all that initially answered "Amen" follow [everyone says the same blessing, one after another]. And one shouldn't protest this, and say that since they have already said "Amen" they fulfilled their obligation, as the one making the blessing does not intend to fulfill the obligation for others; and even if he had that intention, they do not intend to have his blessing fulfill their obligation.

Siman 7

Every day when "visiting the facilities," whether urination or defecation, bless "Who has formed" and not "concerning the washing of the hands," even if one wants to learn or pray immediately.  <i>Gloss: If one has dirty hands when one rubs them (free from dirt), even in such a case, one should not recite "concerning the washing of the hands" (Sefer Mitzvot Ha-Gadol chpt. 27 positive commandment)</i>
One who does netilat yadayim but does not rub off the dirt, even though the recital of Asher Yatzar is necessary, the hand-washing itself is only needed for sanitation and/or because of the notion of "Hikkon" (Amos 4:12) (i.e., preparation for the proper davening mindset).
One who washes his hands and then loses his focus from their purity, and then redecides to wash with water another time - he needs to recite "Asher Yatzar" twice.
There is no specific amount of urinating required, because even if one urinates a single drop one must bless ["who created man/Asher Yatzar"], because  one's opening may have been blocked from urinating that drop and so it may have been difficult for him, and so he is required to give thanks.

Siman 8

One should wrap in the fringed garment and bless standing up.
The order of wrapping is like the way that a person covers his head for work. Sometimes his head is covered and sometimes his head is exposed. And it is correct to cover the head with the fringed garment.
Small fringed garments (talit katan) of ours that are customarily worn, even though they are not wrapped, they fulfill our obligation for fringes. And it is good that one places it over one's head, the long way, and wrap it. He should stand this way wrapped for at least the amount of time it would take to walk four handbreadths. After this he can pull it over his head and wear it normally. 
One should return two of the fringes in front, and two behind, in order to be surrounded by the commandments. 
One should bless "to wrap oneself in fringes". If two or three are wrapped as one fringed garment (that is, each in their own but garment but at the same time) they each bless. If they want, one can bless, and the others can answer Amen.
On a small fringed garment (talit katan) one can bless "to wrap oneself" even though there is no wrapping rather wearing. Ramah: There are those that say ones should bless on it "on the commandment of fringes", and this is the custom and do not change this (Kol Bo Siman 22, and the Nimukei Yosef, Hilchot Ketanot Page 66:)
One must separate the strings of the fringed on from the other. 
One should have this intention in wrapping: That God commanded us to wrap ourselves in it in order to remember all of his commandments and to do them.
Before one blesses he should look at the strings of the fringes if they are kosher, in order that he does not make a blessing in vain.
If one wears a small fringed garment (talit katan) when his hands are still dirty, he should put it on without a blessing, and when he washes his hands he should move around the fringes and bless on it. Or when he puts on another fringed garment, he should bless on it and intend to exempt both on this blessing, and it is then not necessary to move the fringes of the first one.
The essence of the commandment of the small talit (talit kata) is to wear it over one's clothes, in order that he always has awe of God and remembers the commandments. 
If one has multiple four cornered garments, all of them are required to have fringes. If he wears all of them continuously, and this was his intention from the beginning, he only makes one blessing on all of them. If he stops wearing them in between each other, he needs to bless on each one separately. This is the same rule if it was not his intention from the beginning to wear all of them, and it as if there is a break between wearing them. Ramah: Also if he removes the first one before putting on the second one, he needs to return and bless (Terumat HaDeshen Siman 45)
One who wears a small fringed garment (talit kata) and blesses over it, when he walks to the synagogue and wraps himself in the large fringed garment, he needs to also bless on the large one, because the walking from his house to the synagogue is considered a break. If he prays in his house and it was on his mind from the beginning also the large fringed garment, and he did not stop in between to have a discussion or other talking, then he does not have to return and bless again on the large fringed garment. 
If one takes off the fringed garment, even if it was on his mind to return and wrap himself in it immediately he needs to bless when he returns and wraps himself in it. Ramah: There are those who say he does not bless again, if it was on his mind to return and wrap himself again in it (Agur 35). There are those who say this is specifically when the small fringed garment (talit katan) remains on him, and this is how we practice (See below 25:12)
If the fringed garment falls off unintentionally, and he returns and wraps himself again, he needs to bless. This is if the entire talit falls, but if all of it does not fall, even if most of it falls off, he does not need to bless.
One who sleeps with a fringed garment at night, needs to bless on it in the morning even if he doesn't remove it. And it is good to touch/move the fringes in the time of the blessing. And this is the same for someone who puts on his fringed garment before dawn. (Hagahot Maimoni in the name of the Sefer HaTermah, HaSmog, Samak, and Mordechai in halachot tefilin).
If one wears clothing that is obligated for fringes and he does not put on the fringes, he is canceling the commandment of fringes.

Siman 9

The only garments obligated in the precept of tzitzit are those made of sheep wool or linen, but garments made of wool of other animals is obligated in the precept   of tzitzit by rabbinic decree. (and there are those who say every [material] is obligated [in the precept of tzitzit] and this is the halacha) (Tosefta 32, Rosh, Sefer Mitzva Gadol, Mordichai.) 
 Tzitzit of Linen or of sheep wool are acceptable on all kinds of garments except for cases when tzitzit of Linen are put on a garment of wool or tzitzit of wool placed on a garment of Linen in a time when there is no techelet because of the issue of Kilyaim [forbidden mixtures]. REMA: there are some that say not to make tzitzit of linen at all even [to put them on a garment made of] other materials and this is our practice
Tzitzit made from neither wool or linen only fufill the precept of tzitzit with their kind. For example silk tzitzit to a silk garment or cotton tzitzit to a cotton garment, but a garment without tzitzit of its kind does not fulfill the precept.
If put there was put on a tallit of other materials (i.e. not wool or linen) a portion of tzitzit of that material and a portion from wool or linen, there is what to settle with that.
Some say that its necessary that the colour of the tzitzit and tallit are the same and we are accustomed to practice this way.  REMA: and that Ashkenazim there is no custom to make the tzitzit only white, this is in regard also to the clothing's color and there is no need to change [the custom]
Some say not to make a tallit out of linen even though there isn't a halacha [not to do so]. A G-d fearing individual should make a tallit out of wool that it is obligated in the precept of tzitzit from the Torah without a doubt. REMA : if it is only possible for an individual [to fufill the precept of tallit] only with a tallit of linen, better that he fulfilled the precept with a tallit made of linen with linen tzitzit then he void the precept of tzitzit. (Responsa of the Rosh, Section B)

Siman 14

Tzitzit that are made by a Gentile are unfit as it is written "speak to the people of Israel" [this statement addresses jews specifically and] this excludes Gentiles. [If Jewish] women made tzitzit, they are fit. <i>REMA: some are stringent, that they [themselves] will make them [their own tzitzit] and it is good to do so in order to satisfy the law as determined.</i> 
If a Jew put tzitzit on his garment [which is obligated in the precept of tzitzit] without intention [that by putting tzitzit on his garment he will be fufilling the precept], if there are no other tzitzit available [to replace those which were put on without the intention of fufilling the precept], there is what to rely on. The Rambam [halachic opinion is] that the tzitzit [which were put on without intention of fufilling the precept] are fit but one should not pronounce a benediction over it 
Someone who borrows from his friend a tallit that does not have tzitzit on it, he is exempt from putting tzitzit on it for thirty days, as it is written "you and not the other", But after thirty days, you are obligated by the rabbis because it looks like its his. REMA: And if he returns it [the tallit] in the middle of [the original 30 days] and he takes the tallit again [a second borrowing] its not dependent only on thirty consecutive days [but 30 total days] (Nemukei Yoseph Hilchot Tzitzit).if it is borrowed when it has tzitzit, recite a benediction on it immediately. 
It is permissible to take the tallit of his friend and to recite a benediction on it and only [if the tallit is folded]  he will fold it [when he is finished] if it is found  folded. REMA: the same law applys to [use of another's] tefillin (Nemukei Yoseph Perek Haspina). But it is forbidden to learn from holy books of his friend without his knowledge that we are concerned that he will tear them(pages in the book) while he is learning (from them)  
A tallit belonging to partners is obligated  in [the precept of] tzitzit as its written "on the corners of their garment".

Siman 15

One is allowed to transfer tzisis from one shawl to and place them on another shawl; however, he can not transfer them  to another type of garment. <i> Rema: This prohibition applies specifically to one who is obligated to wear these garments. It is allowed to transfer the tzisis of a dead person to any garment. (See Mordechai and Tosafot Shabbat 22a). </i>
...One is not able to take the corner [of a garment] with the tzisis and to sew it onto another garment because of the fact that we require it [tzisyos] to be on the "corner of <b>their </b> garments " (Numbers 15:38), and this corner [that is being sewed on] was not on the garment when it was made. 

Siman 16



Siman 17

Even though it says in the Torah "and you shall see it" a blind person must wear tzitzit because it is included in "with which you cover yourself" and the phrase "you shall see it" is needed to eliminate the requirement of tzitzit at night (see Siman 18).
Women and slaves are exempt [from wearing tzitzit] because it is a time-dependent commandment. <i>REMA: And if they wish to wrap [in tzitzit] and say the blessing on them it is up to them to do so as with all time-dependent commandments (Tosafot and the Rosh and the Ran, Chapter 2, Rosh Hashanah, First Chapter of Kiddushin). Unless they are doing it to appear more observant than others in which case they may not wear them since they are not required as men are (Agur Section 27). [And for slaves] This means we do not have to buy him a tallit in order that he be required to wear tzitzit as we see in Siman 19, it says when he has a shawl with four corners he should wear it.</i> The requirement for a tumtum and an androgynous is doubtful and so they should wrap without a blessing <i>(Explanation: a tumtum does not know whether he/she is male/female, and an androgynous has both male and female genitals).</i> <i>REMA: And since it is our custom that women should say the blessing when they fulfill time-dependent commandments so should they (Divrei Atzmo)</i>
A child who knows enough to wrap in tzitzit must be taught by his father to wear them as part of his education. <i>REM"A: And in particular if the minor knows to put two tzitzit in front and two in the back (Hagahot Maimuni Chapter 3) and knows to hold the tzitzit in his hand during the reading of the Shema (Mordechai, end of Chapter Lulav Hagadol)</i>

Siman 18

Night is not the time of <i>tsitsit</i>, because [the obligation is] limited by "and you shall see it" (Numbers 15:39). According to the Rambam, anything that is worn at night is exempt, even if it is designated for daytime use, and that which is worn in the day is required [to have <i>tsitsit</i>], even if it is designated for nighttime use. And according to the Rosh, a garment which is designated for nighttime is exempt, even if it is worn in the day, and a garment designated for daytime and nighttime is required [to have <i>tsitsit</i>] even if it is worn at night. Rem"a: And a doubt regarding blessings is ruled leniently, so one shouldn't make a blessing on [the <i>mitsva</i> of wearing <i>tsitsit</i>] unless it is worn in the daytime and it is designated for daytime (Beit Yosef). And after the evening prayers, even if it is still day, one shouldn't say the blessing on it (Piskei Mahari, 121). And on the night of Yom Kippur one should put on the garment while it is still day and say the blessing on it (Tashbetz).
Bedsheets, even though one sleeps in them in the morning, should not have <i>tsitsit</i> attached.
From when does one bless on the <i>tsitsit</i> [that he puts on]?  In the morning from the time when [there's enough light that] one can tell the difference between the <i>tekhelet</i> in it and the white in it. And if he puts it on at dawn or later, some say he makes a blessing, and this is our practice (The <i>Mordekhai</i> in the second chapter of <i>Megillah</i>). And if he dons [<i>tsitsit</i>] earlier than that, such as during [the time of year when we recite] <i>slichot</i>, he does not make a blessing over it [right away], and when it becomes light he handles [the <i>tsitsit</i>] and makes a blessing (<i>Tashbets</i>).

Siman 19



Siman 20



Siman 21

The strings of the tzitzit that have stopped their use [by falling off, tearing off, etc.] may be thrown into the garbage, because tzitzit is a commandment that is not holy for its own sake [i.e. tzitzit are only a mitzvah by virtue of their being attached to a four cornered garment].  However, at all times that the tzitzit are attached to a tallit it is forbidden to use them for another purpose, like to bind them to anything else and so forth, because this would be to scorn the mitzvah (and there are those who say that even after they have stopped their use that we do not treat them scornfully by throwing them into a disgusting place, but that they must be ritually buried in a genizah) (Kol Bo Laws of Shabbat).  And there are those who are punctilious to ritually bury them, and for the one who is stringent and careful in the performance of mitzvot, a blessing shall come upon him) (Maharil Laws of Tzitzit)(And see below section 664 paragraphs 8 and 9)).

Siman 22

One who buys a Tallit and makes Tzitzit strings for it, should say the blessing of Shehechiyanu because it is not any less [important] than new vessels. (Explanation: If one did not say the blessing at the time of completing [the Tallit], he should say the blessing the first time he wears [the Tallit]).

Siman 23



Siman 24

If a person does not wear a garment with four corners then he is not required to wear fringes (tzitzit).  However, it is good and proper that a person should be cautious to wear a small tallit every day, in order that he should remember the mitzvot at every moment.  Thus, there are five knots in accordance with the five books of the Torah, and there are four corners, so that in ever direction he faces he will also remember.  It is proper to wear tzitzit on his garments, and at the very least, it is proper that one should wear tzitzit at the time of prayer. 
It is a Mitzvah to grasp the Tzitzit with your left hand near your heart while reciting Kriat Shema. This is alluded to [in the verse] "And these words shall be...on your heart".
It is good to look at your Tzitzit as you are putting them on while you say the blessing. 
Some have a custom to look at their Tzitzit when they reach the verse "And you shall see them," and to place [their Tzitzit] on their eyes. This is a beautiful custom. Addition: Some have the custom to kiss their Tzitzit when they look at them, and all of this is a way of showing love for the Mitzvah (Beit Yosef).
When one looks upon the tzitzit he should look at the two fringes in front of him that have ten knots in total that remind him of his existence, and they also have sixteen strings and ten knots that count as twenty six as in the [letters in the] divine name.
Great is the punishment for one who does not fulfill the mitzvah of tzitzit, for regarding such an individual it is said, that "it might take holds by the end of the earth" (Job 38:13), whereas the one who is careful in the mitzvah of tzitzit is meritorious and sees the face of the divine presence.

Siman 25

After putting on a tallit with tzitzit, put on tefillin because [we do mitzvot] in ascending order of holiness. And those who put their tefillin- and tallit- bags into one bag must take care not to the tefilin on top so that he won't come to them first and have to put them on before the tallit because [of the principle of] not skipping mitzvot. <i>Note: But if he as the tefillin ready but no tallit, he does not have to wait for a tallit, rather he puts on the tefilin and he will put on a tallit when someone brings him one.</i>
Those who wear tzitzit should put on both the tzitzit and tefilin at home and walk to the synagogue wearing tzitzit and crowned with tefilin where he will put on the large tallit. <i>Common practice is to wrap oneself in the large talit as well and then go to the synagogue</i>
RO"Sh said the morning blessings all at once until "who hath crowned Israel in glory," donned his tefilin and then made that blessing.
A man must be wearing his tefilin during the Shema and Amidah.
When putting them on, have in mind that God commanded us to "put these four passages which contain [the principle of] monotheism and the Exodus on the arm opposite the heart and the head opposite the brain so that we may remember the miracles and wonders that He did for us which indicate His Unity and that He is omnipotent in heaven and on earth." And to submit to God his soul, which resides in the brain as well as his heart which represents physical desire. Through this he will remember the Creator and moderate is pleasure[-seeking]. He should put on the arm-tefillin first and say the blessing "... to place the tefillin" and afterwards put on the head tefillin without a second blessing. <i>Note: Some say to make a second blessing on the head tefillin "...on the mitzvah of teffillin" and this is the Ashkenazic custom.</i>
[Even] if he touched the head tefillin first he must skip it and put the arm tefillin on first.
The brachah is pronounced "l' - HUH - knee - ahh" with a kamatz under the ה
All blessings made on mitzvot are done <strong>before</strong> doing the mitzva. Therefore one must put the tefillin on the biceps, then make the blessing and immediately tighten it. <i>Note: Similarly, the blessing on the head-tefillin must be made just before pushing it down tightly on the head.</i>
It is forbidden to speak at all between putting on the two tefillin, and if he spoke, he must make the blessing on the head tefillin. <i>Note: Since we [Ashkenazim] make two blessings, he must make both blessings on the head tefillin</i>
If he said something necessary for [putting on] the tefillin he does not have to make a new blessing. However he may not make any prayer responses including Kaddish and Kedushah.
After tying the arm tefillin to the arm, put on the head tefillin before winding the strap around the arm. There are those who forbid removing the head-tefillin from the bag before putting on the arm-tefillin. <i>Note: Even if they are both already out, do not open the head tefillin before the arm tefillin is on. There are those who say to put on the arm-tefillin sitting and the head standing but in our area we do both standing.</i>
Someone who puts his tefillin on multiple times in one day has to make the berachot each time. This includes replacing them if they slipped slightly, <i>(Note: If he only displaced one of them, he only has to make one blessing.)</i> even if he moved them himself intending to replace them immediately. <i>Note: Others disagree with this last bit</i> Someone who put on the arm tefillin, then found that he has to retie it, as long as he was not distracted and did not yet put on the head tefillin, he does not have to make the blessing again. However, if he already put on the head-tefillin when the arm-tefillin came untied, he has to start the process over.

Siman 26

If he only has one tefillin, he should don the one he has and bless upon it, for each tefillin individually is its only mitzvah.  And this is the law: if he has two of them, and there is any forced reason that he be unable to wrap a second one, he should wrap the one that he is able.
If he is able to wrap the head tefillin only, he should upon it recite the blessing "on the mitzvah of tefillin" only.  Comment: And among us it is customary to say two blessings over tefillin each day.  One blesses "upon the head" by itself two blessings (also Baruch Shem), and if he dons the hand tefillin only, he blesses "who dons" only (Tur).

Siman 30

The time to put them [Tefillin] in the morning is at the time when one can see his close friend from four cubits away and  recognize him.
One is prohibited to put Tefillin on at night since he may forget [that he has them on] and sleep in them. But if he puts them on before the sun sets and it happens to get dark, even if he wears them the whole night, it is permitted. We do not teach like this if he did not remove the Tefillin from when the sun set  since he had no place to guard them and therefore, left them on to protect them. This is allowed and is such taught.
If one wanted to go out on his way early [in the morning, before the actual time that is permitted to put them on], he puts them on, and when their time comes ,he should feel them and make the bracha on them. There is no need to be concerned that he may sleep in them since he is getting up to go on his way.


Siman 31



Siman 32

The commandment of "Tefillin" is to write four passages i.e. "Kadesh" until "m'yamim yamimah"(Exodus 13:1-10); "v'haya" until "mimitzrayim" (ibid 11-16); "Sh'ma" until "uvish'arekha" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and "v'haya" until "al ha'aretz" (ibid 11:13-21) Note: They must be written in this order, that is the order they appear in the Torah and if [the scribe] deviates from this order [the tefillin] are invalid. Ideally the arm-tefillin should be written before the head-tefillin.
The head [tefillin] should be written each [parasha] on its own parchment and the arm [tefillin] should be written all [four] of them on a single piece of parchment.
They should be written in black ink, whether or not the ink contains gallnut juice (tannic acid). Note: It is preferable to be careful to write only with ink made of wood- or oil- smoke soaked in gallnut juice and see also Y"D 271. If he wrote even one letter in a different color the tefillin are invalid. If he gilded the letters, he can remove the gold and leave the bottom letters and the tefillin will be valid but if he gilded one of the Divine Names there is no solution because removing the gold would constitute erasing a Divine Name [which is forbidden].
No letter may touch another; rather each letter must be completely surrounded by parchment. <i>Note: And he must write [in a] uniform script which does not miss even the serif on one yud, and has the ornamentation required by halacha. It is preferable to write a little boldly so [the writing] will not fade quickly. Similarly it is meritorious to make them as nice as possible both inside and out.</i>
Even an ambidextrous person must write with his write and the tefillin are invalid if he wrote with his left. [However] a left-handed person's left hand is considered his [and the laws are reversed].
One must only score the top line unless he cannot write straight without it in which case he just score all the lines. The scoring should not be done with lead so as not to leave a colored mark <i>Note: Some say one must always score every line and mark the margins the same way even if he can write without it, and such is the custom.</i>
It is a Received Tradition going back to Moses that tefillin [are written] on the <i>klaf</i> layer, not on <i>dukhsustos</i> or <i>gewil</i>; on the <i>klaf</i> layer, on the flesh side and any variation is invalid. What are [these layers]? When a raw skin is split thickness-wise, the outer layer towards the fur is klaf and the inner one towards the meat is dukhsustos. Thus when we say "the flesh side of the klaf" we mean the side closer to the flesh i.e. where it connects to the dukhsustos. Our parchment which is not split, is halachically klaf and we write on it on the flesh side since what is scraped away from the hair side is just enough to smooth it out and would be scraped off even if we were to split the hide, while on the inside all the dukhsustos is scraped away.
The parchment must be processed with gallnut juice or lime and must be processed for the appropriate purpose. It is proper to declare verbally at the beginning of hte process that he is preparing it "for tefilin" or "for sefer torah" but if parchment [used for tefilin] was prepared for mezuzah, it is invalid.
If a non-Jew processed the parchment, RaMBa"M disqualifies it but RO"Sh does not, as long as a Jew supervises and helps. <i>Note: In a small part of the process. And such is the custom.</i>
When hides are marked with an awl in shapes like letters, we do not assume they are forged even if it would be easy to do so because the non-Jew would be afraid that the Jew [who made the marks] would identify them.
[The question of] whether or not hides processed with incorrect intent can be reprocessed with the proper intentions is addressed in the Tur, Y"D 271.
The parchment must be [made] from the skin of a kosher animal, domesticated or not, and even from a carcass or roadkill. It may not be made from the skin of any non-kosher animal as it is written: "That the Torah of God be in your mouth" i.e. that the Torah itself must be made from halachically edible species. Parchment [for tefilin] may not be made from the skin of fish -- even kosher ones -- because of its excessive stench.
The parchment should be whole, without any holes that ink cannot fill, i.e. that [the ink should not fall through the gap and] make the letter appear split.
Meticulous scribes make three grades of parchment: on very thick for the shorter Shema, a slightly thinner one for Kadesh and V'haya ki y'viacha (exodus) which are longer and the thinnest for V'haya im shamoa which is the longest, and through this fill the compartments evenly which makes the tefilin look nice.

The Mitzvah of Tefillin earns a lot of reward, and one who does not wear tefillin in general is committing a crime against Israel in itself.
It is a Mitzvah to have it [tefillin] on all day, but because the body needs to be clean, which tefillin does not allow one to do, and one is not allowed to distract his mind from them, and people are not able to be careful, so we do not put them on all day.  Nevertheless everyone needs to be careful with them, so we put them on during the reciting of Shema and prayer [because we concentrate on holy things at those times anyway].

Siman 38



Women and slaves are exempt from Tefillin because it is a positive commandment which is caused by time. Rem"a: And if the women want to be stringent for themselves, we protest against it (Kol Bo).

We say the prayer Baruch She-amar ("Blessed is the One Who said") prior to Pesukei Dezimra ("the Psalms of Praise") and we say Yishtabach ("May he be Praised") after these.
If one finished Baruch Shemar prior to the prayer leader he should say Amen after the leader finishes.
After Yishtabach one may say Amen after the blessing itself (see below section 215).
One must be cautious to refrain from chatting from the moment he begins Baruch Sheamar until after he concludes the Eighteen Benedictions (The Amidah).  And even if it is for the sake of performing a mitzvah one may not talk between Baruch Sheamar and Yishtabach (Beit Yosef quoting the Kol Bo)(see below 53 and 54).
In between these psalms one may ask [of another's welfare] out of respect [for that person] and may reply greetings to any person.  And in the middle of the psalm he may ask [of another's welfare] out of fear and he may reply out of respect.
One should pause between the words "foreign gods" and "But Adonai made the heavens."
One should focus one's heart during the verse "God opens up God's hand," and if he does not focus then he must return and say the verse again.  Comment: And we say the verse "And we shall praise Adonai" at the end of the Ashrei ("A Psalm of David") (Tur and the Kol Bo), and we double-recite the verse "Let every living soul praise God" because it is the conclusion of "The Psalms of Praise" (Tur), and so too for the verse "Adonai will rule forever and ever (Abudraham).  And when one comes to "And now Adonai our God we thank you" or to the verse "And on every level they must bow to you" one must not talk and must bow there as it is written below in section 113 (Rebbe Yitzchak, at the end of the chapter "Ein Omdin," and Rabbeinu Yerucham Pathway 1).  And it is customary to stand when we say "Baruch Sheamar" and "And David Blessed" and "Yishtabach."
We aught not say these songs hurriedly, but rather at a pleasant pace.
A Psalm of Thanksgiving should be said in a melody because in the future all of these songs will be cancelled except for a Psalm of Thanksgiving.  Comment: And we do not say a Psalm of Thanksgiving on Shabbat or holidays (Tur) or on the days of Pesach, because the Thanksgiving offering was not sacrificed on those days on account of Chametz, and it should not be recited on the eve of Passover, and see below section 429, and not the eve of Yom Kippur, and see below section 604, and thus it has become customary in our lands (Customs):

Siman 52

If one comes to synagogue and find the congregation at the end of the P'sukei D'zimra service, he should say "Barukh She'amar" until "M'hulal B'tishbahot" (i.e. the end of the blessing), and afterwards "T'hillah L'david" until "Me-atah v'ad olam halleluyah" (i.e. all of Ashrei). And afterwards "Hal'lu et Hashem min hashamayim" until "Livnei Yisrael am k'rovo hallelulyah" (i.e. Psalm 148). And aftewards "Hallelu el b'kodsho" until "Kol han'shamah t'hallel yah" (Psalm 150). REMA: And if he has more time, he should say "Hodu lashem kiru" (I Chronicles 16:18-36) until "v'hu rahum" (during the anthology of verses from Psalms) and skip to the "v'hu rahum" [immediately] prior to Ashrei because in between [those separate instances of "v'hu rahum"] are simply gathered verses (Hagahot Miyymonei Chapter 7 from Hilkhot T'fillah). And afterwards Yishtabah, and aftwards Yotzer [Or] (i.e. the blessing before Ahavah Rabbah, the paragraph immediately prior to the Sh'ma) and the Sh'ma and its blessings [by which he should] pray with the congregation. And if he doesn't have much time, he should also skip "Hal'lu et Hashem min Hashamayim." REMA: If there is still not enough time, he should only recite Barukh She'amar, T'hillah L'david (i.e. Ashrei), and Yishtabah (The Rosh and the Ri from the Chapter "Ein Omdin"). And if the congregation has already started with Yozer and one does not have time to recite P'sukei D'zimra even with skipping, he should recite the Sh'ma and its blessings with the congregation and pray with them, and afterwards recite all of P'sukei D'zimra without a blessing before or afterwards. REMA: And in any case, he should say all of the blessings required of him to bless in the morning ("Kol Bo" and "Beit Yosef" from the Mahari as it is explained in Siman 46 and 47).

Siman 53

The leader should say Yishtabach while standing.
One should not say [i.e. lead] Yishtabach [i.e. Shacharit] unless he has also said Barukh She'Amar and some of P'sukei D'Zimra

The leader must be one who is fit. Who is "fit"? One who is free of sin; who has never had a poor reputation, even in his youth; who is humble; who is acceptable to the nation; who is skilled at [liturgical] chanting; whose voice is pleasant; who is accustomed to reading Torah, Prophets, and Writings (i.e. biblical text).







One should not hire a person [to be shaliach tsibbur] who reads "aleph" like "ayin" and "ayin" like "aleph".


A permanent leader goes before the ark himself and doesn't wait until someone asks him to.
One who is not a permanent leader must hesitate a bit before he goes before the ark, but not too much; rather, the first time he should hesitate, and when they ask him again he should ready himself as if he wants to go to [lead], and on the third time he should go to before the ark. If a great man told him that he should go before the ark, he should not hesitate at all.
If the leader should err and they need to replace him, the one whom they ask to replace him should not hesitate at all.

The time of reading Shema is from when one can see a slightly familiar friend at a distance of four amos and can recognize him. It continues until the end of three [halachic] hours, which is a fourth of the day[light]. The most ideal fulfilment of the mitzvah is to read it around sunrise, that is they should prepare to read it a little before sunrise in order that one should finish Shema and its blessing with the sunrise and that the Shmonei Esrei will be immediately adjacent to sunrise. Whoever is able to prepare to do this, his reward will be very great. RAMA: The measurement of sunrise is about one hour before the entire sun has ascended above the land.
If one didn't read it before sunrise, one should read it as soon as he is able to. 
And whoever is prevented beyond his control, such as one who got up early to travel and in that place there are bands of wild animals and bandits where he is not able to concentrate, even for the first section until "Your heart," or members of the caravan are going quickly and they won't wait for him at all, then he can read it with its blessings from daybreak, because it's still fitting to call daybreak "when you rise up" and it's also fitting to call it "creation of light." But, if he's not in a place that has bands of wild animals or bandits and the members of the caravan are not so rushed, even if one left to travel after daybreak, he shouldn't read until the proper time arrives.
If one read from daybreak [but before the proper time to read Shema], even though he wasn't in a circumstance beyond his control [that prevented him from reading Shema at the appropriate time], he fulfilled his obligated after the fact. If one read it without its blessings, he should return to read it in its appropriate time with blessings (see below Siman 60).
If one was in a circumstance beyond his control [that prevented him from reading Shema at the appropriate time], and didn't read the evening Shema until daybreak, since it's still not yet sunrise, he may read Shema and fulfill his obligation of the evening Shema. If he was in a circumstance beyond his control at the same time (to go on the way to a place with bands of wild animals and bandits) one should not read the Shema a second time to fulfill his obligation of the daytime Shema because once he made that time "night," it's impossible to retract and make it "day."
Even though its time continues until the end of the third hour, if the third hour passed and he did not read it, he may read it with its berakhot all the fourth hour, since it's a third of the day. And he doesn't have a reward like one who reads in its time, and if the fourth hour passed and he didn't read it, he may read it without its berakhot all day.
If one does not read [Kriat Shema] by day there are those who say that there can be recompense [by reading it] at night, and that if you did not read the Shema at night that there can be recompense [by reading it] during the day, and there are those who disagree.

Siman 59

1. "Blessed are you Adonai our God who creates light and darkness" was fixed to mention the attribute of darkness during the day to address the claim of heretics who say that "The one who created light did not create darkness."
2. If one erred [while praying] and said "the one whose word brings forth evening" but remembered immediately and said "who creates light," and then ends with "creator of lights," he has fulfilled his obligation.  However, if he says "the one whose word brings forth evening" and he did not say "who creates light" or did not conclude with "creator of lights," then he has not fulfilled his obligation.  And if he said, "the one who creates day and night and whose word brings forth evening," and he concludes with "brings forth evening," he has not fulfilled his obligation.  Comment: And this is the law.  If he only said at first "creator of lights" or he ends with "brings forth evening" then he has not fulfilled his obligation (these words are further explained in the Tur and the Rosh).  However, if he concludes with "creator of lights" since he opened with "creator of light" he has fulfilled his obligation even though he ended with "brings forth evening."

4 The blessings for Yotzer (morning) and Maariv Aravim (evening) should be said alongside the prayer leader at a pleasant pace.  Comment: And one should hasten to conclude before the prayer leader in order to answer Amen after the prayer leader (Hagahot Maimoniyot 1 from Blessings of the the Rokeach 218).  Nevertheless, if he did not say it but only listened to the words of the Shaliach Tzibbur then he has fulfilled his obligation with regard to these blessings, because with regard to these blessings the prayer leader can fulfill the obligation of one person, even if he is an expert.  Nonetheless, the prayer leader may not fulfill the obligation of others with less than a minyan (Rabbi Yitzchak on Mi Shemeyto).  However, one should not answer Amen after the blessing "the one who has chosen Israel with love," because this constitutes a pause (see above chapter 61) 

Siman 60




There are those who say that mitzvot do not require intent and there are those who say they do require intent to fulfill the obligation to do that mitzvah-- and the latter is the ruling.

Siman 61

One should recite the Recitation of the Shema with intention, awe, fear, shaking and trembling. 


They are accustomed to recite the first verse in a loud voice in order to awaken the intention [we need].
They are accustomed to place their hands on their faces during the recitation of the first verse in order that one will not look at another thing that will restrain him from intending [his heart].
 ...






After the first verse, one needs to say, "Blessed is the name [of the one], his glorious kingship lasts forever" in a whisper. ...
One needs to pause a little between “forever” and “you shall love” in order to interrupt between acceptance of the kingship of Heaven to other commandments…



One should pronounce the zayin in "tizkeru" in order that one not hear "tishakru" (reward) or "tishkaru" (drunken).  If one said that, he would be like a slave only working for reward. Similarly, you also have to pronounce the zaying in "vizkartem."







There are those who are accustomed to recite the Recitation of the Shema in a loud voice and there are those who are accustomed to recite it in a whisper. Kol Bo: And in any case, they say the first verse in a loud voice, and this [is what we] are accustomed [to do].

A handsbreadth that is uncovered on a woman in a place where it is her practice (lit. way) to cover it, even if it his wife, if it forbidden to read the Shema in front of it. &lt;rema&gt; And some say that this is specifically with respect to his wife but with another woman even less than a handsbreadth is Erva (lit. nakedness).  And it seems from the words of the Rosh that a handsbreadth on a woman is Erva even to another woman, except that by herself she is able to read [the Shema] even though she is naked like was said earlier in Siman 74.
The hair of a woman that it is her practice (lit. way) to cover it, it is forbidden to read [the Shema] in front of it &lt;rema&gt; even his wife &lt;rema&gt;.  But virgins that it is their practice to go with an uncovered head, it is permitted. &lt;rema&gt; And so too is the law with the hairs of women that regularly come out of their barriers and certainly foreign (detached) hair even if it is her practice to cover.
One should refrain from hearing a woman's singing voice during the reading of the Shema. &lt;rema&gt; and even his wife.  But the voice that is regular to him is not Erva (lit. nakedness). 
It is forbidden to read [the Shema] in front of Erva, even that of a non-Jew, and so too in front of the Erva of a child.  And there are those that permit in front of the Erva of a child so long as he is not capable of intercourse.  &lt;rema&gt; And that is the main opinion.

The time for the morning tefillah is commanded that it begin with the rising of the sun, as it is written, "They will revere You with the sun (Psalm 72:5)." And if one prays from the time of dawn and the illumination of the east, one has fulfilled his obligation and continues until the fourth hour which is a third of the day.  And if one errs or transgresses and prays after the fourth hour until noon, even though he does not earn the reward for praying at the proper time, he has still fulfilled  the obligation.  [Isserles:  And after noon it is forbidden to pray the Tefillah of the morning (Beit Yosef in the name of  the Rashba [Rabbi Shlomo ben Adret], Chapter Morning Prayer) .  See below the beginning of Siman 108]. 

Siman 90

One who prays, he should not stand on a bed, a chair, a bench (even if they are not 3 [hand-breadths tall]- Beit Yosef in the name of Mahari"ya), and not on top of any high place, except if he was old or sick [and thus cannot descend], or if his intent was to make the congregation hear him [ie. a <em>chazzan</em>].
The measure of a high place is three hand-breadths. If it is three [hand-breadths] tall, and it has an area of four cubits by four cubits, it is like an upper story and it is permissible to pray upon it. And so too, if it was surrounded by dividers, even if it is not an area of four [cubits] by four [cubits], it is permissible to pray upon it, for it's height is not recognized once its domain is separated.
The craftsmen doing work for the house-owner may pray at the top of the olive tree, and at the the top of the fig tree, and the rule of 'One should not stand on a high place and pray' does not apply in this case, for as soon as they have ascended to do their work, they are considered like someone who ascended to the second story of a house. But with regard to all other trees, it is necessary to descend, and the reason that [the rule of] the olive tree is changed from all other trees is that they have many more leaves than other trees and thus it is a hardship to climb them and descend them, and so they [the craftsmen] will take breaks from work [normally, and stay up in the tree], and therefore they said that they should pray there, but regarding the other trees, which do not have [the craftsmen taking] breaks from work [and remaining in the tree], they should descend. And the house-owner, even if he is at the top of the olive or date tree, must descend to pray, for he is not bound to his [place of] work, for he is in his own property. And even though they were lenient regarding workers because of breaks from work, they were not lenient regarding the house-owner.
It is necessary to open openings or windows in facing Jerusalem, so as to pray opposite them. And it is recommended for a synagogue to have twelve windows.
One should not pray in an open place, such as a field, for one someone is in an enclosed place, the fear of the king falls upon him and his heart breaks [in prayer].
And [one should] not [pray] in a ruin, because of the fear, because of collapses, and because of the evil spirits.


















A student of a <em>chaver</em> is allowed to pray behind his teacher.
Any place that we may not read <em>Shema</em> in, we may not pray there. And just as we distance from feces, urine, a putrid smell, a corpse, and from the seeing of <em>ervah</em> for the reading of <em>Shema</em>, so too we distance in prayer.
If he was standing in prayer and a child urinated in the synagogue, he should remain silent [ie. stop praying] until they bring water to  dilute the urine [thus 'removing' it], or he should walk in front of it four cubits, or to the side, or he should exit the synagogue, and he should finish praying. <em>A thought: And it is better to go to a different place rather than be silent, for he might wait as long as [the time required] to finish the whole </em>[Amidah]<em>, and [thus] he shall be required to return to the beginning (Beit Yosef in the name of the Rokeach, Siman 224. And see above [in the Orach Chayyim], Siman 79). </em>

If one arises to pray and is standing outside of Israel he should turn his face in the direction of the Land of Israel and should direct his heart to Jerusalem and the Temple and the Holy of Holies.  If one is standing in Israel he should turn his face toward Jerusalem and direct his heart toward the Temple and the Holy of Holies.  If he is standing in Jerusalem he should turn his face toward the Temple and direct his heart also to the Holy of Holies.  If he is standing on front of the lid to the ark one should turn his face toward the lid of the ark.

One who prays needs to intend in their heart the meaning of the words which are coming out of their mouth. They should think as if the Divine Presence is before them, and remove all distracting thoughts from themselves, until their thoughts and intention are pure in their prayer. And one should think, if they had to compose one's words before a king of flesh and blood, how they would prepare the words and say them with great intention, without any stumbling, hence [one should do this] all the more so before the King of kings, the Holy One of Blessing, He who sees all thoughts. And so did the pious ones and the mystics, who secluded themselves and concentrated on their prayers until they achieved the falling away of their corporeality and the enhancement of the strength of their consciousness, until they came close to the level of prophecy. And if another thought comes to one in the midst of prayer, they should be silent until it is nullified. And one should think about things that humble the heart and direct it to one's Father in Heaven, and not think about things that make one light-headed. Gloss: Before prayer, one should think about the exalted loftiness of Hashem and the lowliness of humankind, and remove all human pleasures from their heart. And it is forbidden for people to kiss their small children in synagogue, in order to fix in one's heart that there is no love like the love of the Infinite.

One who prays needs to have concentration on all the blessings, but if he is not able to concentrate on all of them, he should at least concentrate on the blessing of the forefathers (the first blessing of Shemonah Esrei), but if he doesn't have concentration while saying the blessings of the forefathers, even if he has concentration on the rest [of the blessings], he needs to return [to the beginning of Shemonah] and pray.  Gloss: Nowadays we do not return because there is a loss of concentration, and even when he returns [to the beginning of Shemonah Esrei] he will not have concentration; if so, why should he return (Tur)?


Siman 102

...It is forbidden to be within four cubits of one who is praying, in front of him or to the side of him (or behind him) (Tosfos Mordechai and Ashrei Chapter Ein Omdin) you need to stay four cubits away.  If he is dealing with things that have to do with prayer, and in the chapter of Eizehu Mekuman [it says that in the previous case] he doesn't need to further himself [from the person praying].  There are those that permit [being within four cubits of someone praying] when he is learning Torah, and even though it is not related with prayer, and there are those that say that these words are only talking about when you [are within four cubits] to the side, but if you are in front [of the one praying] even if [the person who is praying's] eyes are accustomed to [the person learning in front of him], it is forbidden, even if he is learning Shema.
...There are those who say that one is permitted to sit on the side of a person that is praying, if he is quiet.
...If one [is praying] and sitting next to another person, and [the one who is praying] stands up next to the other person, [the one who isn't praying] does not need to stand up, because [the one who was praying] came inside his borders. (and nevertheless it is a kind thing to even in this case)(Beit Yosef in the name of Mehariyah).

If one erred or was forced [by circumstance] and did not pray the morning prayer, one prays the afternoon prayer twice: the first is the afternoon prayer, and the second as compensation.

There is no Birkat Kohanim when there is less than ten men, including the Kohanim in the minyan. (And a non-Kohain does not say Birkat Kohanim even if there are Kohanim present.)(second chapter in Ketubot, the non-Kohain annuls a positive commandment.)
Any Kohain to whom one of the inhibiting factors does not apply who does not go up to the duchan, even though he has annulled one positive commandment, it is as if he has annulled three if it was when, in the Beit Hakeneset, they called, "Kohanim," said to go up, or told them to wash their hands.
If he had gone up once already that day, he has not annulled even if they told him, "Go up."

































A kohen who killed a person, even by accident, may not raise his palms even if he repented. Haga"h: And some say that if he repented he may raise his palms. And there is (room) to be lenient on the repentant to not close a door before them. And so is the custom. (His own opinion, because it is no worse than an apostate.) (Tur, Rash"i and many deciders, Agur and Beit Yosef)

And it seems that this [the rule of adding an extra Aliya] is [also] is the rule for the head of a Brit Milah, because it is like Yom Tov for them, like it says later in Siman 559 (and the rules of Shabbat and Yom Tov are seen later in Siman 362 to see more on this topic).
The place that we stop on Shabbat - that we stop on Shabbat morning, we [start to] read [from] there at [Shabbat] Minchah, on Monday, on Thursday, and on the following Shabbat [morning]. Gloss: If they neglected [to be able to hold] the public reading of the parashah, then for the following Shabbat they read that parashah (i.e. the missed one) along with the parashah belonging to that (i.e. the following) Shabbat (Or Zarua) (and see below, chapter 282).
A Priest reads first from the Torah,followed by a Levite, followed by Israel.
The simple custom that even a Cohen, who is a regular guy, reads before a great [Torah] scholar that is a Yisraeli [someone not from the tribe of Levi] if he is a Cohen that knows how to read (and one who is able to read word for word with the leader of the congregation comes has precedence over everyone like it says later in Siman 139) (Abudraham), and if he doesn't know how to read how should he bless the Torah?

Siman 137

On a day that 3 read, we do not read less than 10 verses. [The frequent short introductory verse] "And [the Lord] spoke..." is included in the count [of verses]. And if the subject ends in less than 10 verses, for example the section of Amalek [Exodus 17:8] that has none other than 9 verses, it is all right.
Each one does not read any less than 3 verses. Two read 3 and one reads 4, and whichever one of them it is who reads 4, behold this one is praiseworthy.

If one read 2 verses, he needs to go back and read [again]. And if they did not read between the three of them any other than 9 verses, 3 for each of them, there is no need for them to go back and read [again]. And proof of the matter is the chapter of Amalek [Exodus 17:8-16]. But if they read less than 9 they need to go back and read [again].

There was a first Torah reader, and the second [reader] read what the first had [already] read: if he added 3 verses to what was already read by the first or even 2 in a place where there was no possibility for it (i.e. adding 3), the second is included in the count [of valid aliyot], but if not, he is not included in the count. [This] excludes [the portion of] the bulls of [Chol HaMoed] Chag (i.e. Sukkot) because there is no possibility [of adding additional verses].

Siman 138

The one who reads the Torah may not leave over any less than 3 verses in a paragraph because of those who leave the synagogue then and will say that the oleh (i.e. reader) after him will read nothing but the two remaining verses [of the paragraph]. And similarly, one may not begin less than 3 verses into it (i.e. a paragraph) because of those who enter the synagogue then and will say that the first [reader] did not read anything but 2 verses. Gloss: And there is no difference between an open paragraph and a closed paragraph. And a paragraph that does not have [more than] just two verses: it is permitted to leave over [these two verses] at the beginning [of a paragraph] and to stop there (T'rumat HaDeshen, Chapter 54). And one should aim to always begin to read on a good matter and to end on a good matter (Or Zarua and Meimuni, Chapter 13 of Hilkhot T'fillah). And see below, Chapter 428.

We skip in the Prophets, but we do not skip in the Torah from one section to another section. And these words are regarding two subjects where we are worried that perhaps the mind of the listeners will be confused, but with one subject, for example “Acharei Mot” [Lev. 16:1] and “Akh Be-asor” [Lev. 23:27] that the High Priest reads on Yom Kippur, we skip. And it is so he will not recite [the portion] by heart, as it is forbidden to recite even one word that is not from writing. And in the Prophets, we skip even with two subjects. And this is if one does not delay when skipping into [another] matter so that the congregation stands in silence [waiting]. And these words are regarding within one [book of the Prophets], but from one [book of the Prophets] to another [book of the Prophets], we do not skip. And within the Trei Asar (i.e. Twelve Minor Prophets), we skip from prophet to prophet. And this is only so long as one does not skip from the end of the book to its beginning.

It is not proper to roll the Torah scroll in the presence of the congregation, so as to honor the congregation. And if they only have a single Torah scroll and they have to read two portions they may roll, and they defer the honor of the congregation

One should not behave in a frivolous manner in a synagogue or house of study, by cracking jokes there, for instance, or by indulging in humorous or pointless gossip. One should not eat or drink there nor should one adorn oneself there or walk about there. One should not enter there in summer to cool off or in winter to seek shelter from the rain. In an emergency, scholars and their disciples are permitted to eat and drink there. No monetary calculations should be made there unless they are for religious purposes, collecting money for charity, for example, or for the redemption of captives. No funeral orations should be delivered there unless it is for one of the leading citizens of the city when all assemble there for the purpose. If a man finds it necessary to enter there for his own needs, to call someone, for instance, he should read or study something and then call him so that it should not appear as if he has entered for his own needs.... It is forbidden to have even a short nap in a synagogue but this is permitted in a house of study. 


It is permitted to eat and sleep in the synagogue if it is for religious purposes. For this reason [of religious purpose overriding the prohibition] one may sleep in the synagogue on Yom Kippur.

After this he should go to his work because any Torah that does not have work with it will end up becoming null and it causes sin because the poverty will remove from him knowledge of his Creator. Nevertheless, he should not make his work primary, rather temporary, and his Torah permanent. And (through this) both will be sustained.
He should do business honestly and be careful not to mention the name of Heaven in vain, because in every place where the mention of God's name (in vain) is found, death is found. And he should be careful not to swear, even in truth, because 1,000 cities belonged to King Jannaeus and all of them were destroyed because they swore, even though they kept them.
And he should be careful from partnering with the Kusim; perhaps (the Kusi) will be obligated to swear (agains him) and (the Jew) will violate, "(The names of other gods) should not be heard through your mouth."
Rama: And some are lenient with partnering with Kusim these days because the Kusim of these times do not swear by idol worship. And even though they mention the foreign idol, nevertheless their intention is to the Creator of heaven and earth, except that they join the name of Heaven and (foreign gods). And we do not find that there is in this (a violation by the Jew of) "Before a blind person you shall not place a stumbling block," because the kusim are not enjoined regarding partnership (of God with idols). (Ra"n in the last chapter of Avodah Zarah, Rabbeinu Yeruchem path 17 part 5, Tosfos in the beinning of the first chapter of Bechoros).
And to do business with them without partnering all agree is permitted except on the day of their festivals. (Hagahos Maimoni first chapter of the Laws of Idol Worship) (And see Yoreh Deah in the Laws of Idol Worship chapter 147.)

One who defecates and subsequently wants to eat should wash his hands twice, and say Asher Yatzar on the first washing and Al Netilat Yadayim on the second washing.  And if one only wants to wash his hands once, after he washes he should say the blessing of Asher Yatzar, and afterward at the time he dries [his hands] he should say the blessing of Al Netilat Yadayim.
If many people are at a meal, the most important one should wash first.  And the Rash [says] it is normal for him [the most important person at the table] to wash last in order that he should not have a pause, and he should not speak [between washing and eating bread].

Siman 166

There are those who say that one need not be careful about pausing between washing and [the Brachah of] Hamotzi, and there are those who say that one needs to be careful [and there are those who say] it is good to be careful.  Walking  22 cubits is considered a pause (Tosefos Perek Elu Ne'emarim).

......
Bless "Hamotzi lechem min ha'aretz" [Who takes out bread from the ground] - (And if many people are eating together, the people dining should direct their heart (intention) to the person saying the beracha, and answer amen, and the person saying the beracha should give intention to the amen - Or Zarua). And one pauses slightly between the word "lechem" [bread] and the word "min" [from].
Do not bless "Hamotzi" before grasping the bread.
Put both hands on the bread when you are about to bless "Hamotzi"; for the 10 fingers are reflective of the 10 mitzvot that are dependent on bread. Additionally, there are 10 words in the blessing of "Hamotzi" and 10 words in the following verses: Psalms 104:14, "He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and grass for the service of man: that he may bring forth bread out of the land." Psalms 145:15, "The eyes of all look to you expectantly, and you give them their food at the proper time." Deuteronomy 8:8, "A land of wheat and barley, of vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey." Bresheit 27:28, "May G!d give you from the dew of heaven and fat of the earth, and an abundance of grain and wine."

Laborers doing work for their employer should abbreviate the grace after meals so that they do not take themselves away from the work of their employer. How (do they abbreviate the grace after meals)? (They recite) the first blessing as established and the second they begin with "the blessing on the land" then include in it "He who builds Jerusalem" and conclude with "the blessing on the land". They do not recite the blessing of "The one who is Good and does good" at all. In what circumstances does this apply? When they are receiving payment for their work besides the meal (they are provided with). However, if they are not taking payment but rather are only provided with the meal they eat, they should recite all four blessings as established. This is also the case if the employer is eating with them, even if they are taking payment in addition to the meal, they should recite all four  blessings.

Three people that ate together, but forgot and benched by themselves, missed the mitzvah and they are not allowed to return and say the Zimun out of order.  And also if two of them benched together but one forgot, the other two can have a Zimun with the third, even though he already benched, he is able to say "Baruch She'achalnu Mishelo," and they [the other two] fulfill their mitzvah of Zimun through this, but he [the third one]  doesn't fulfill his Mitzvah, because he did it out of order.  Gloss: and if the third one did the Zimun with others, the first two cannot do the Zimun with him (Beit Yosef in the name of Rashba).

 One who sees a place where a miracle happened to a single person does not make a blessing; but if it was to himself, he blesses, "who made a miracle for me in this place." And all of his descendants also bless, "who made a miracle to my father in this place."...




There are those who say that one should only recite a blessing over such a miracle that defies the ways of the world. However, for the miracle that is within the ways of the world, e.g. dangerous robbers coming by night and no one being harmed, etc, one is not obligated to recite a blessing. But there is a difference of opinion regarding the above, so it is good, after all, to recite a blessing [for the natural miracle] but without saying G-d's name and the epithet of majesty, i.e. omitting the words "Lord, our G-d Majesty of the World..." in the blessing.

On news that are good for him, he makes the blessing of "Shehecheyanu"; If the news is good for him and for others, he makes the blessing of "Hatov VehaMaytiv". 
On bad news he makes the blessing: Blessed are you Hashem, Our G-d, Master of the Universe, the judge of truth.”
 A person is obligated to bless on the bad with a full mind and wanting soul, in the way that he blesses happily on the good, because the bad, for servants of G-d, is their happiness and goodness. Since he/she has accepted out of love what G-d has decreed, he/she finds that by accepting this bad, he/she is serving G-d which bring him happiness.
He blesses on the good: “Hatov Vemaytiv” even though he is fearful that bad might come from Him. For example: He found a “prize” and he is fearful that it may become known to the king and the king will take all that he has. He blesses on the bad: “Blessed Judge of Truth”, even though good will come from Him. For Example: a flood has washed away his field even though when the flood passes, it will be good for him, as the field has been watered.

Upon a comet, which is like a type of star that is seen like an arrow across the sky from place to place, whose light stretches like a staff, and upon shaking of the earth, and upon lightning, and upon thunder, and upon winds that blow angrily: on each of these one says, "Blessed are you, God our Lord, king of the world, creator of the original (first) creations." And if you'd like, say, "Blessed are you, God our Lord, king of the world, whose strength and might fill the world."

Siman 228

Upon oceans, rivers, hills, mountains, and deserts one says, "Blessed are you, God our Lord, king of the world, creator of the original (first) creations."  And upon the great ocean, and that is the ocean that is crossed to Israel and to Egypt one says, "Blessed are you, God our Lord, king of the world, creator of the great ocean."
Not on every river should you recite the blessing, but rather on the 4 rivers, as it is written "like Chidekel and Euphrates." And he who saw them in a place that wasn't normally walked by people.
And not on every hill and mountain should you recite the blessing, but rather only on hills and mountains that stand out as recognizably great and awe-inspiring.

And [this applies] even he is ten stories high, where he cannot reach it [the candle], as the rabbis did not differentiate [between varying situations] in this matter.

Gloss: And only on Shabbat on the matter of 21 verses: three verses for each one of the [seven Torah] readings, but on a Festival on which five read [the Torah], fifteen verses suffice (Maharam ???). And it was not decreed that the haftarah is only [read] in public after they read the Torah (Ramban’s Responsa, Siman 199), but nevertheless it is forbidden to read with the blessings before it and after it; but with no blessing it is permitted (Beit Yosef).

One should be very cautious to have a third meal, and even if he is satisfied he can fulfill it with about the volume of an egg. And if he cannot eat at all, he need not cause himself discomfort. And a wise person will not fill his stomach with the morning meal, so as to save room for a third meal. Hahah: And one who did not eat on Shabbat evening should eat three meals on the day of Shabbat. 
The time [of this meal] is from the time of minhah, which is from the sixth and a half hour onward. And if he does this earlier, he has not fulfilled the mitzvah of the third meal. Hagah: There are those who say that it is prohibited to drink water from Minhah until Maariv on Shabbat for that is when the souls return to Gehinom. And therefore one should not eat the third meal between Minhah and Maariv. Instead he should eat it before Minhah (Tosafot Harosh and Mordecai, chapter ten of Pesahim). And there are those who say that it is is preferable to pray Minhah first (Rambam, Tur, Hagahot Mordecai, Hagahot Maimoni, chapter 30 and Agur). And this is our preferred custom in all of these lands. And in any case one should not drink water from the rivers, but it is permissible in one's house. And all the more so other liquids are permissible (Hagahot Maimoni, chapter 30). And there are those who say that this is prohibited only during the twelve months after one's mother or father died (Agudah and Mordecai, chapter 10 of Pesahim). And there are those who say that this prohibition of drinking water is only on Friday eve (Tosafot, Rosh, and Mordecai in the name of R. Meshulam, and Hagahot Maimoni.)

Gloss: If one says non Shabbostic things just to have a good time, it is permitted to say these things, but if it does not bring them joy, it is forbidden to talk about it.
...It is forbidden to hire workers and not say to a Jew to not hire workers on Shabbat, even though the Jew only needs the work done after Shabbat, it is forbidden.  It is forbidden to say to a Jew to do work, and even to say to him before Shabbat, it is forbidden.  But one is allowed to say to do it after Shabbat, so he does not do a weekday thing on Shabbat, even though he knows his want is to do it on the next Shabbat.

A dead body that is in danger [of being burned] in a raging fire:  If there is a baby or loaf of bread, you should move the body with it.  If there is not a baby or loaf, then if two matresses are avaliable, flip the body from mattress to mattress since this is indirect motion (tiltul min hatzad).  If neither are available, you may move the body explicitly.  All of these apply only if in one domain.  If the body is currently in a very sunny place, you may move it to a shady area by means of a baby or loaf as long as it remains in one domain.  However, if there are no babies or loaves available, it may not be moved, even by the method of flipping mattresses, since indirect motion [in the standard case] is called motion.

4. If a dish has been thoroughly cooked, the prohibition of cooking still applies if it has cooled down. RMA - There are those who say that this only applies if the dish continues to improve in quality (Rabeinu Yerucham); And if the dish has not been fully cooked - even if it has been partially cooked - the prohibition of cooking applies to it even when it is still hot. And this which we have said that the laws of cooking apply to a cooked dish applies only to dishes with liquid. However, a dish which is cooked and is dry may be placed in hot water on shabbat. If it is a dry food which which was not cooked prior to shabbat, one may not place it into hot water, but one may pour hot water on to it, excepting old herring and Spanish tuna which only need a small amount of cooking and pouring will cook them. RMA - This is the case for all hard things which aren't edible at all without soaking - one may not soak them as this completes their cooking process.
5. There are those who hold that a thing which as been previously roasted or baked is prohibited by the laws of bishul to be cooked again in water - and it is forbidden to put bread, even in  secondary vessel which is hot enough to cause the hand to recoil. There are those who permit this. RMA - In a secondary vessel. There are those are lenient even in a primary vessel (which was at one point on the flame) and the custom is to be strict in the first instance not to put bread into a secondary vessel the entire time that it is hot enough to cause a hand to recoil from it.



In the case of a primary vessel (meaning a vessel which is used on the fire) even after it has been removed from the fire it can cook items placed in it, as long as the pot is less than Yad Soledet Bo. Therefore, it is forbidden to place in it spices (category of tavlin), however, Salt may be placed in it… GLOSS: …there are those who prohibit placing salt in a secondary vessel as long as the temperature is above Yad Soledet Bo, a blessing should come to those who are stringent… 

Regarding a tub for washing [a human] which is full of hot water (even though it is as a secondary vessel) [Tosafot, Rosh, Tur]: it is forbidden to pour cold water into it as it will heat up the water quite a bit. However, one may put hot water from one tub into another tub which contains cold water.
Regarding an urn which has been emptied of water, one is permitted to put [much] water inside of it in order to make the water temperate. It is also permitted to pour hot water into cold water, or cold water into hot water - this is on the condition that it is not into a primary vessel, as that will heat the water very much. RMA - And if the water is so plentiful that it is impossible that it will cook, rather it will only become temperate, this is permissible even into a primary vessel provided that it is no longer on the flame.
It is permissible to place an ewer of water or any other liquid into a secondary vessel which contains hot water. It is forbidden to do this in a primary vessel.
It is permissible to place an ewer of water or other liquid near a fire in order to make the liquid temperate, provided that it is far enough away that it cannot reach the point where it becomes hot enough for the hand to recoil (hot enough to burn), that is a place which is hot enough that the abdomen of a baby will be burned. It is forbidden, however, to bring it close enough to the fire where it is in a place that it can heat up to the level that the hand will recoil; this applies even to leave it there for a few moments in order to warm the water because the ability to cook the water exists. RMA - this is the law regarding fruits and all food which can be eaten raw.
Food which is cooked thoroughly and is dry without any liquid, one may place next to the flame, even in a place where it will become hot enough for the hand to recoil. RMA - even if it has cooled down already. But if it is still hot, even a food with liquid may be placed there. And there are those who are lenient and say that as long as one doesn't place it directly on the fire or stove, rather near it, even if it is completely cold, it is permitted. And the custom is to be lenient on this as long as it hasn't cooled down completely.
It is permissible to put an empanada near the fire in a place where the hand will recoil, even though the congealed fat contained inside of it will melt. RMA - All the more so with a pot of food which has congealed sauce, when the melted fat is not recognisable, it is permissible. And there are those who are strict. The custom is to be strict, but in a case where there is need, one may trust the first opinion.
It is forbidden to put cold liquid on top of an urn, even just to warm it up, as long as the urn is hot enough to cook if the food is left long enough - this is that the urn is hot enough to cause a hand to recoil. The laws pertaining to an urn are the same as those pertaining to a hot stove. If the urn is not so hot, it is permissible.

An egg that was laid on Shabbat is forbidden even to touch, and even if it got mixed in with a thousand [other eggs that were not laid on Shabbat] it is forbidden to touch any of them, but one is able to cover it with a vessel in order that it does not break as long as he doesn't touch it.
When Shabbat falls after Yom Tov or it falls before [Shabbat] it is forbidden [to touch it on the second day, whether it be Shabbat or Yom Tov].
Fruits that fell from the tree on Shabbat are forbidden in the day, but in the night they are permitted immediately.

Someone on whom a collapse [as of a building] has fallen, and itis doubtful whether he is alive or dead, doubtful whether he is there or not, and even if he is there it is doubtful whether he is Jewish or and idolater, they remove the collapse for him even though there are several doubts.

Even if they found him [in exremis], that he can only live for a short hwile, they remove the collapse and check until his nose, and if they do not sense at his nose life then he is definitely dead - it does not matter whether they reached his head or his feet first.


(A group of) idolaters that have laid siege on Jewish cities; if they have come for financial matters, the Shabbat is not violated for them. If they have come to take lives, and even if they have an unannounced purpose, we go out and greet them with vessels of war and we desecrate the Shabbat. And as for a city which is close to the border, even if they have not come except regarding matters of straw and stubble, we desecrate the Shabbat for them. Note: And even if they have not yet come but they want to come (Or Zarua):

Making sound with a musical instrument is forbidden, but knocking on the door, and similar such things, which are not done to make music, are permitted.  Rema: So too, if one does not perform an act of song.  Therefore, those who call out to their friends, or whistle with their mouths like a bird - this is permitted on Shabbat (Hagahot Alfasi). And it is forbidden to bang on the door with a ring that is fixed to the door. Even though it is not intended for song, nevertheless, since the device is specially made for this, it is forbidden.  Therefore, it is forbidden to use any special device to bang on the door to the Synagogue. Rather, one should knock with his hand on the door. (Igur, Beit Yosef, based on the rulings from Tosafot in Eiruvin).

Siman 339



One should not clap one's hands together, nor clap a hand on one's thigh, nor dance - this is a decree instituted so that one will not come to fix a musical instrument. And even tapping one's fingers on the ground, or on a board, or snapping them together like singers do, or rattling nuts together for a baby, or playing with a pair of them, so that he will be quiet.  All this and similar such things are forbidden from a decree, so that one will not come to fix an instrument.  But clapping the back of one's hand is permitted.  (Rema: But there are those who clap and dance nowadays, and we should not stop them. Because it is better that they do it unintentionally... And there are those who say that today all of this is permitted, because we are not experts in fixing instruments, and we cannot decree "lest one comes to fix an instrument" for it is a thing which happens so infrequently. So it is possible that because of this, the custom is to be lenient on all of this. (Tosafot, Perek HaMeivi Kadei Yayin))

One who marries a widow does not come to her [have sex with her] for the first time on shabbat or a holiday. See also (Shulchan aruch, Orach Chayyim, siman 280).

About a courtyard with many houses that open up into it, the Rabbis prohibited carrying from house to house until they create an eruv in which they have collected bread from each household and place it in one of the houses in the courtyard. With this method, we see that it's as if all citizens [of the courtyard] are living in one house and the entire courtyard is designated to that one house.

Each man has under him, and further, each person has four amot (cubits) in every place, even if he went outside of the barrier and we measure for each person his "amah", and if he has short limbs, we give him four average-length amot, each of which is six handbreaths. <i>Gloss: And these four amot are measured wide with him in the center (Tur). And there are those who say that he is permitted to walk four amot on each side but carrying, he only has four amot at the diagonal, as was explained before in Siman 349 (Tur in the name of the Raza''h and the Maggid Ch. 12 in the name of the Rashbah.</i>
In any place that he finds himself when Shabbat begins, if he is in an enclosed space for dwelling, even if there are no inhabitants, all of it is considered like four amot, and if it is not an enclosed space for dwelling, until it contains two seahs, all of it is considered like four amot, and even he is on a tall hill, an harvested area with stalks and barley surrounding it, it is considered like four amot until it contains two seahs.

One who leaves the Shabbat barrier even a single amah (cubit), he should not enter to be like a member of the city, and he only has four amot from [where] he is standing and out.
If his leg is inside the barrier and one leg is outside the barrier, he should enter.
One, when Shabbat begins, is outside the barrier of the city, even a single amah, he should not enter to be like a member of the city, and he should only walk two thousand amot in each direction from the place he was in when Shabbat began.
One who leaves the barrier without knowing, it is permitted to make a divider for himself of what people made an eruv with, in that direction and they are able to walk there. And they will make around him like a divider and he will enter between them. And the one who does not know the ones who made their dividers that are called like this, but if he left knowingly, it is prohibited.
The one that was taken out of the Shabbat barrier by non-Jews or a bad spirit or other unwilling [removals] or by accident, and he left, he only has four amot. They return him within the barrier, it is like he did not leave, and the whole city is like four amot like at first, and beyond that two thousand amot in every direction. But, if he returns knowingly, he only has four amot. <i> Gloss: And if he entered a boat and the boat went out of the barrier, and returned afterwards to the port that it departed from, it is like he did not leave, because it is considered like non-Jews took him out and returned him (Or Zarua).</i>
Non-Jews place him outside of the Shabbat barrier in an enclosure, in a prison, or in a cave, or in a different city surrounded by a wall as a dwelling, or he was forced the rest of the types of forced circumstances, or it was an accident and he went out of the barrier and entered into one of those, and then he remembered and he was inside, he can walk in all of it; but if he went out of the barrier knowingly, even though it was one of these, he only has four amot.
The one that departed on his boat in the sea, he can walk all of it since he stopped in the "air" of the dividers; and if the walls of the boat were opened on Shabbat, if it went, he can walk all of it, if it stands, he can only walk four amot. <i>Gloss: And if in the middle, he has ten walls and he does not have anything on his head, we go after the middle, and even if he does not have anything other than to draw a limit of ten, that we say, we limit to complete (Or Zarua). </i>
He if went out knowingly and returned by way of non-Jews, he only has four amot; however, if he went out of the city <i>walled for dwelling (The Rosh chapter One who went out and Rabbi Yerucham HY''H and Or Zarua)</i> all of it is like four amot; and even if he went out knowingly and returned knowingly. <i>Look later of the laws of cities Siman 401.</i>
Fruit that was taken out of the Shabbat barrier and returned, they do not lose their place as the whole city is for them like four amot and two thousand amot further in every direction like from the outset if it is a Yom Tov; And if it is Shabbat, it is permitted regarding eating in their place, and even for the same Jew that returned them for his need intentionally, 49, they are forced circumstances. And the whole time that they are not returned and they are outside their place, if he took them out accidentally, it is permitted to eat them, but it is prohibited to move them out to eat them for four amot, and if he took them out intentionally it is prohibited to eat them even one who did not take them out. And there are those who permit for the one who did not take them out.

Siman 406

One who went out of the Shabbat barrier unknowingly, he only has four amot, and if he needs to "go do the bathroom", he is able to leave from there until he finds a private place to turn; and it is good advice that he approaches the side of the barrier, because if he does not find a private place until the barrier he can enter, and after he enters, it is like he did not leave since he entered with permission; but if he found a private place first, he should not enter except to face there, and he should distance himself from the place he turned until he covers the smell, and there he has four amot. And if he distances himself from the smell and enters into the barrier, it is like he did not leave. And if he went out knowingly, he has no fix. This that we said, regarding the need to "go to the bathroom", there are those who say even for minors and there are those who say specifically for adults.

Siman 407

One who went out of the Shabbat barrier with permission, for example a midwife brought a child or things like that, she has two thousand amot in each direction from that spot that he arrived at; and if he arrived to a city, then he is like the people of the city and he has two thousand [amot] in each direction outside the city <i>look before at the end of Siman 248.</i>
If he goes out with permission and walks on the path, and they said to him: the mitzvah is already made when you went out to do [it], he has from his place two thousand amot in each direction; if he has a little of the barrier that he went out from with permission, it is absorbed within the two thousand amot that he has from his place, when he returns to his place it is like he didn't go out.
All those that go out to save life from the hands of non-Jews, or from the river, or from the rubble, he has two thousand amot in each direction from the place that he saved them; and if there was an attack by non-Jews, and they were afraid for Shabbat in the place that they saved them, they return on Shabbat to their place and their weapons.

Arvit, Shacharit, and Mincha, one prays 18 blessings and says, "Ya'aleh v'yavo." And if one did not say it in Arvit, we don't make him go back, <i>and at the place that he remembers and doesn't go back, see Siman 294, Seif 4 and 5</i>, regardless if Rosh Hodesh is one or two days, because we don't sanctify the month at night. But if one did not say it in Shacharit or Mincha, we make him go back. And if it is remembered before he begins "Modim", he says it in the place that it is remembered. And if it wasn't remembered until after he began "Modim", if it is remembered before he completed his prayer, he returns to "R'tze." And if it is not remembered until he has completed his prayer, he returns to the beginning. And if he is accustomed to say supplications after his prayer and he remembers after he completed his prayer before he uprooted his feet, he returns to "R'tze." <i>Gloss: And if its doubtful if he mentioned it or not, he does not have to go back (Kol Bo in Hilchot Tefilah). And the prayer leader that forgot from mentioning it in Shacharit, see Siman 126.</i>
And we recite Hallel in skips, either as individually or publicly. And there are those who say that the public bless over it in the beginning to recite Hallel, <i>and if he blessed to complete, he does not need to go back (Mordechai Chapter "With what do we kindle and Stalks of Wheat")</i>; and at the end, "Y'hallelu'cha." And an individual does not bless over it. And there are those who say that even the public does not bless over it, not at the beginning nor at the beginning, and this is the position of the Rambam, and we are accustomed with all the kingdoms of the Land of Israel and its surrounding areas. <i>Gloss: And there are those who say that also an individual blesses over it (Tur in the name of the Rosh and Rabbeinu Tam). And we are accustomed to do this in these countries. And in any case one should be careful to recite publically in order to bless on it with the public. And there are those who say that when a person recites individually, and two that say it with him the beginning of the chapters that this is like [when] many [recite] (Mordechai Chapter "With what do we kindle and accumulations" in the name of Shocher Tov). And they are accustomed to this in "Hodu" and not in "Ana."</i>
Regarding the subject of verses that are doubled, and also the verses that the prayer leader says and the community answers after him, each place [should do] according to their custom.
Regarding the subject of stopping, even in the middle, one greets a person with "Shalom" and he needs to treat them with honor and respond "shalom" to everyone, but regarding after he should not stop. <i>And specifically with Rosh Hodesh and Passover on days that we does not complete Hallel, but when we complete it, regarding the subject of stopping, it's law is like the recitation of the Shema. See Siman 488, Seif 1.</i>
If he stopped and waited, even if he waited the length of time it would take to finish all of it, he does not have to go back to the beginning.
The one who recites Hallel out of order, he did not fulfill [his obligation]. <i>If he made a mistake, he should go back to the place he made a mistake (Rabbi Yerucham).</i>
The mitzvah of reciting Hallel is [done] standing.

Nine piles of matza, and one of chametz, and a mouse comes and takes [from the piles] and we do not know if the mouse took chametz or matza, and the mouse entered a checked house - you must return and check it (however, if the food is small enough that the mouse could have eaten it - we can rely on a leniency that the mouse did eat it, and you do not need to check) (Tur), as every established place is like a half of a half [i.e. each established location is treated as its own majority]. If the food was separated from its established place, and the mouse took it from there - you do not need to return and check it, as anything separated [is considered to be] separated from the majority.

One who sleeps during the meal and wakes, does not return to eat. Members of a group, some of which slept during the meal, may return and eat. If they all slumbered and awoke, the may not eat. If all of them napped, they may eat. Haga: And all of this only apples where they slept after they began eating the Afikomen.

On the second night after the evening prayer, we begin to count the Omer. And if someone forgot to count, [that one may count] from the beginning of the evening onwards. He may account all night. It is a mitzvah for each person to count for themselves. He needs to count standing and bless before. He should count the days and weeks. How? On the first day he should say “today is day one of the Omer”, until he arrives to seven days. [At which point he should say], “they are one week of the Omer.” And on the eighth day he should say “today is eight days and they are one week and one day of the Omer.” And also, when he arrives to the 14th day, he should say “today is 14 days, they are two weeks of the Omer.” And in this way he should count and onwards until the 49th day.
 If they (the people who are counting) made a mistake on a cloudy day and they blessed on the counting of the Omer, they should go back to count when it got dark.  Those who are punctilious, they do not count until the stars come out [namely, three stars], and this is a proper thing to do.
The one who prays with the community during the day, he should count with them without a blessing. And if he remembers at night, she should bless and count. GLOSS: And even if he answered “amen” to the blessing of the community, if he had the awareness that he was not fulfilled [of his obligation], he may go back and he may bless and count that night.
The one who asks his friend [during the period of time] between sunset and when the stars come out, “how many days of the counting [of the Omer] is it tonight?”, he should say to him, “yesterday was such and such.” Because if he had said to him, “Today is such and such,” he would not be able to go back  and count with a blessing. However, [if he answered back] before [the period of time] between sunset and when the stars come out [he can go back and count], since it wasn’t the time of the counting of the Omer [which is when it is night time] and it doesn’t count for anything. GLOSS: And when the time arrives [to count], it is forbidden to eat until he counts and even if he began to eat, he should stop and count. However, if he began to eat before the time [to count] arrived, it is not necessary for him to stop except [when] he finishes his eating and counts afterwards.

[The time period between Pesach and Shavuot is called the Omer]. The minhag is not to marry a woman between Pesach and Shavuot until Lag baomer (33rd day) because during that time the students of Rabbi Akiva died. But to get engaged it’s allowed. And if someone does marry we don’t punish him and after Lag Baomer it is all permitted. 
2. The minhag is not to get a haircut until Lag baomer because then the students stopped dying. But one should not cut one's hair until the 34th in the day unless the 33rd is erev Shabbat, then you may cut hair on the 33rd because of honoring the Shabbat. GLOSS: In these states we don't follow his position rather we cut hair from the day of the 33rd and add some extra joy and we don't recite the prayer of Tachanun. But you don't cut hair until the day of the 33rd not the night before. However if the 33rd falls out on Sunday we have a custom to cut hair on the Friday before out of respect for Shabbat. Someone celebrating a Brit Mila may cut his hair duing the Sefira in honor of the festivity. 
3. Some have the custom to cut their hair on Rosh Chodesh Iyar but they are mistaken. GLOSS: however in many places some have the custom to cut their hair until Rosh Chodesh and they should not cut their hair form the 33rd day and onwards , even though it is permitted to cut on the 33rd day itself. Those who do cut their hair after Lag Baomer do not make any exceptions after Pesach until the 33rd day. One city should not have customs of both sides in the same city because of the prohibition of 'do not make groups'. And of course one should not be lenient with both at the same time.
4. Women have a custom not to do work between Pesach and Shavuot from sunset and onwards. 

Siman 494

The fiftieth day of the count of the Omer is the holiday of Shavuot.  The prayer service is like the holiday of Passover, rather we say "the Holiday of Shavuot, the time of the giving of our Torah".  We say full Hallel.  We take out two Torah scrolls and read in the first one of five [sections] from "The third month" until the end of the order.  The Maftir is read in the second scroll, "On the day of the first fruits".  As Haftorah we read the chariot of Ezekiel, and end with the verse "and the wind took me up."
On the second day, we read in the section (Deuteronomy 15:19) "Every firstborn" until the end of the portion. The Maftir is read like the previous day, and as Haftorah we read in Habakkuk from "And Hashem in His Holy Sanctuary" until "for the conductor with my melodies". 
It is prohibited to fast immediately after the holiday of Shavuot. Ramah: And we do not say Tachanun from the beginning of Rosh Chodesh Sivan until the 8th day, which is after the post-holiday day (Hagahot Maimoni, Hil' Tefillah Umnagim). We have the custom to spread out plants on Shavuot in the synagogue and in houses, as a memory for the happiness of the receiving of the Torah. We have a custom everywhere to eat dairy food on the first day of Shavuot. And it seems to me that the reason is: It is like the two foods that are taken on the evening of Pesach, a reminder of the Korban Pesach and a reminder of the Korban Chagiga, so too we eat a dairy food followed by a meat food, and we bring with them two loaves on the table in place of the Mizbeach, and thus there will be a reminder of the two loaves that were brought on "The day of the Bikkurim."

We are all obliged to fast these four fasts and it is forbidden to breach the fence. Gloss: However, women who are pregnant or nursing and would suffer a lot do not need to fast ... and even if they would not suffer they are not obliged to fast, unless they are generally strict [as regards fasts]. This [ruling] applied to the three minor fasts, but on Tish'ah Be'Av, they must complete the fast (see below in Section 554, paragraph 5).
On these fasts, except Tish'ah B'Av, one may wash oneself, anoint oneself, wear shoes, and have marital relations.  One need not cease eating and drinking [before the fasts] while it is still daytime.

At the time when the Temple was destroyed, the sages of that generation decreed that one should not paint and mold one's house like the house of kings, but rather one should plaster one's house with mortar and whitewash it with lime. And one should leave a place, a square cubit in size, opposite the entrance, without whitewash. And if one acquires a painted and molded courtyard, this is permitted as it is already like that, and one is not obligated to peel away what is on the walls.
And similarly, they decreed that one who lays a table for guests should leave something missing and leave a place without a bowl (that would have been suitable to place there). And when someone makes ornaments/jewellery of silver or gold, they should leave one missing from the kinds of ornament which are customary, so the ornament should not be complete. And when the groom marries a woman, take ashes from burnt food and place them on his head, in the place where the Tefilin rest. Gloss: There are places where they are accustomed to breaking a cup during the wedding ceremony, or placing a black cloth or other such items of mourning on the head of the groom. And all these things are in order to remember Jerusalem, as it is said, "If I forget you, Jerusalem...if I do not raise up Jerusalem over the height [head] of my joyfulness..." [Psalm 137:5-6]

Eat a head of a lamb saying: Let us be as a head and not a tail. It is also a remembrance of the ram of Isaac. Rema: There are those who are careful not to eat nuts, as the word "egoz" in gematriah [is equal to the value of] chet (sin). They also cause a lot of excess saliva and phloem and cause abrogation of prayers. They also go to a river and say the verse: And Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea (Micah 7:19). There are also those who do not sleep during Rosh Hashana during the day, and this is the correct thing to do.

1. One must blow standing. Rema: And it is our custom to blow on the bimah in the place where we read [Torah].
2 Before one blows one makes the blessing "to hear the sound of the shofar" and makes the blessing "shehecheyanu." Rema: And there is no distinction between blessing for oneself or if one has already fulfilled [the obligation of blessing] and blesses to fulfill the obligation of others. Either way, the one blowing makes the two aforementioned blessings (based on Beit Yosef and Trumat HaDeshen). And one blows Tekiyah Shevarim Truah Tekiyah three times; and Tekiyah Shevarim Tekiyah three times; and Tekiyah Truah Tekiyah three times. Rema: And it's best to blow on the left side if possible to blow this way (Minhagim). And also to direct the shofar upwards as it is said "Raise up G-d with the shofar" (Rokeach and Maharil).

How many Tekiahs is one obligated to hear on Rosh HaShana? Nine. (This is) because it says "Teruah" by Yovel and Rosh HaShana three times. And every Teruah has a straight (blast) before it and a straight (blast) after it. And from tradition (the Sages) learned that all Teruahs of the seventh month, whether on Rosh HaShana or Yom HaKippurim of Yovel, (are) nine Tekiahs. We blow on each of them TR"T, TR"T TR"T.
This Teruah that is said in the Torah, it is doubtful to us if it is the wail that we call Teruah or if it is what we call Shevarim or if they are both of them together. Therefore, in order to remove any doubt, one needs to blow TSR"T three times, TS"T three times and TR"T three times.

The Chazan reviews the (silent) prayer. And we blow on the order of the blessings: for Kings TSR"T once, for Remembrances TS"T and for Shofars TR"T. And now we have the custom to blow for Kings TSR"T three times, for Remembrances TS"T three times and for Shofars TR"T three times. HAGA"H: And some say that we blow TSR"T for Kings once and also for Remembrances and also for Shofros (Tur quoting Rabbein Tam and Minhagim). And so is the custom in these provinces...

That which [people] are accustomed to perform kapparah before Yom Kippur by slaughtering a rooster on each male and to say verses over it, you should prevent the custom. Ramah: And there are those from the Geonim that write about this custom, and similarly it is written from many Achronim [Rishonim], and so is the custom in all these countries [Ashkenaz] - and you shouldn't change, for it is an ancient custom.

On the night of Yom Kippur it is customary that the Chazzan says, 'In the heavenly court and in the earthly court, with the permission of the Omnipresent and with the permission of the congregation, we permit to pray with sinners.'. And it is customary to say 'Kol Nidre' etc. And after that one says 'Shehecheyanu' without a cup. Rema: And after that they pray the evening service.  And it is customary to say Kol Nidrei while it is still daytime, and to continue with singing until nightfall. One says it three times, and each time one raises one's voice more than previously. (Maharil). Similarly the Chazzan says ,'And the whole community will be forgiven.' And the community say three times, 'And the Lord said, 'I have forgiven like you said.''. One should not deviate from the local custom even concerning the tunes and piyutim that are said there.

On Succot we shall dwell for 7 days etc. Because on Succot I protected the children of Israel. These refer to the clouds of glory who protected them from all the intense heat and the sun of the desert.  And it is a Mitzvah to begin building the Succah immediately after Yom Kippur.  For if a Mitzvah that comes to one's hands, one should not delay performing it.

One is allowed to fast the day before and after Chanukah and Purim. 
We fast on the 13th of Adar.  And if Purim falls on Sunday, we start the fast on Thursday.  Gloss: This fast is not required, therefore you can be lenient for the time of the fast, for example: one who is pregnant, nursing, or not dangerously sick.  And even if only you have pain in your eyes that is bothering you a lot - you shouldn't fast, and fast on a later day.  But other people [who don't have these conditions] - they should not [fast] at a separate time from the rest of the congregation.  And if Purim falls on Sunday, and the fast moves to the Thursday before, and it falls on a circumcision, you are allowed to eat for the circumcision, and the next day on Friday, those who ate should fast.
There are those who fast three days for the fast of Esther.

Siman 687

One is obligated to read the megillah at night and return and repeat it during the day. And for the [reading] at night - its time is all night, and for the [reading] during the day - its nice is all day, from sunrise until the end of the day; and if one read it from daybreak - he has fulfilled [his obligation.] 
We cancel Torah learning to hear the megillah, all the more so for the rest of the mitsvot of the Torah, because all of them are pushed aside before the reading of the megillah. And there isn't anything that pushes aside megillah from before it, except for an unclaimed dead body that does not have anyone to bury it (according to its need), because the one who happens upon it - he buries it first and afterwards reads [the megillah]. Ram''a: And all of this is only dealing with [a situation] in which one is able to do the two of them. But if it is impossible to do the two of them, there is not a Toraitic mitsvah that pushes aside megillah from before it (Ran and Beit Yosef in the name of the Tosafot and Mehar''a Mizrachi). And the unclaimed dead body comes first, this is precisely when it is possible for him to read afterwards (Mehar''a Mizrachi).

Siman 689

All are obligated in reading [the megillah]: men, women, resident aliens, and freed slaves. We teach the children to read.
It is the same whether one reads or hears from someone who reads - he has fulfilled his obligation.  That is, if he hears from someone who is obligated in reading it.  Therefore, if the reader was a deafmute, or a minor, or mentally infirm, one who hears from him does not fulfill [his obligation].  And there are those who say that women do not fulfill the obligation for men.  Gloss:  And there are some who say, if a woman reads for herself, she blesses "to hear the megillah," because she is not obligated in reading (Mordechai first chapter of megillah)
An Androgynous fulfills the obligation for his kind, and not for those not his kind.  A Tumtum and someone who is half slave, may not fulfill the obligation even for his own kind.  Gloss:  There are some who say that he cannot even fulfil his own obligation, and he must hear from others.
One who hears the megillah from someone from whom he is sworn not to accept benefit, has fulfilled [his obligation].
In a place with no minyan, if one [person] knows it and the rest do not, one can fulfill [the obligation] for them all. If they all know, everyone reads to himself.
It is a good tradition to bring male children and female children to hear the reading of the megillah.

Siman 690


















The Megillah [of Esther is read] on the 14th [of Adar in unwalled cities] and on the 15th [of Adar in waled cities], [and] one must make sure that [he is attending the Megillah reading among] a [congregation of at least] ten men. And if one cannot find [a congregation of] ten men, one may read it by himself. Gloss [of Rabbi Moshe Isserles]: It is uncertain if women are [legally counted as composing part of] a congregation of [at least] ten men. If [the Megillah] is read in a congregation [of at least ten men], and an individual happened to not hear the reading, he should read it on his own (even though ideally, one must seek a congregation of at least ten men), since [at least] it is being read in his city amongst a congregation [of at least ten men]. And when an individual (not amongst a community) reads it during the time [period when it is legally required], he must make a blessing (special blessing acknowledging the requirement of reading the Megillah) on it.

All people must give at least two gifts to two poor people. <i>Rem"a: Some say that there is [support] to give prior to Purim a half-coin that is established in that place and in that time as a memorial to the Shekel half-coin that they would give in Adar. And since "terumah [tithe]" is written three times in that portion, there is [support] to give three [half-coins] (Mordechai, beginning of the first chapter of Yoma). And there is [support] to give on the night of Purim prior to praying the Mincha prayer (Maharil), and such is the custom in all these provinces. And there is [support] to give 3 half-coins of the bigger [coins] in these provinces, for there is no coin that is only half beside for [the bigger coin], and in Austria, they would give 3 half-coins of Vienners, which were also called "halfs". And so it is for each province. And only someone who is 20 or older is obligated to give. And some say that one should give the half-shekel to charity in addition to these three halves, but that is not the custom. </i>

Siman 695

One who does the Purim meal at night does not fulfill his obligation. Rama: Nevertheless, one should be happy and add more during his meal even at night (Teshuvat Mahariv).
One is obligated to be intoxicated on Purim to the point where he does not know [the difference] between "accursed is Haman" and "blessed is Mordechai". Rama: Some say it is not necessary to become drunk so much, but rather to drink more than he is used to (Kol Bo), and to fall asleep, and while he sleeps he does not know [the difference] between "accursed is Haman" and "blessed is Mordechai" (Maharil). [There is no difference] between one who has more and one who has less, as long as his heart is directed to heaven. One should not fast on Purim, except for a fast for a [bad] dream, and see earlier Siman 568 and Siman 570. There are those who have the custom to dress in Shabbat/Yom Tov clothes on Purim, and that is correct (Maharil). We have the custom to make the Purim meal after the afternoon prayer, and pray the evening prayer at night. We pray the afternoon prayer while most of the day remains, and most of the meal needs to be during the day (Minhagim). And it should not be like those who have the custom to start close to evening, and most of the meal happens during the night of the 15th. When Purim falls out on Friday, they should have the meal in the morning because of honor for the Sabbath (Minhagim). And one who wants to [have his meal] every [Purim] in the morning is allowed to (T"H). Some say that there is [significance] to eating seeds on Purim as a remembrence for the seeds that Daniel and his friends ate in Babylonia (Kol Bo). It is good to delve a bit in Torah before one begins the meal, and a support for that is (Esther 8:16) "The Jews had light and happiness...", which we learn out "radiance" - that's Torah (Mahariv). One is obligated to drink a little and be a little happy on two days, the 14th and the 15th (Minhagim), and so is the custom. And some say that if one causes damage to his fellow through his happiness on Purim, he is exempt from restitution (T"H Siman 110). And see T"H Laws of Damage.
One says "Al hanisim" in the Grace After Meals during the blessing of the land ["Nodeh"]. And if one started his meal during the day, and extended it into the night, he [still] says "al hanisim", for we follow the [status of] the beginning of the meal. And some say one should not say it. Rama: And we have the custom like the first opinion. 
One must send to his fellow two portions of meat, or foodstuffs, as it says (Esther 9:19) "And send portions, man to his fellow." Two portions to one man [is the obligation]. And anyone who send more to his fellows is praiseworthy. If he has none, he can trade with his fellow, this one sending to that one his meal, and this one sending to that one his meal, so that they can fulfill "And send portions, man to his fellow." Rama: And some send the portions during the day and not at night (from the Rosh, first chapter of [Bavli] Megilla). And if one sends portions to his fellow, but he doesn't want to accept them, or he forgives him [his obligation], he fulfills [his obligation nonetheless]. And a woman is obligated in [sending] portions to the destitute and sending portions [to one's fellows] like a man is. A woman sends to a woman, a man to a man. But not the other way, so that a man does not come to send it to a widow, and it will come to a possibility of kiddushin [having been enacted]. But portions to the destitute one should not worry [about this possibility].

Siman 696

One may do work [which is forbidden on the Sabbath] on Purim, but places that have the custom not to should not, (Rama: And today, all places have the custom not to (Kol Bo)), and anyone who does will never see blessing from that work, unless it is a joyful building, such as a house for a newly-married son, or an arbor for kings and officers. Rama: And it is permitted to do work for a mitzva, such as writing Torah law decisions. And similarly it is permitted to do even work in the fullest sense for the needs of Purim (T"H Siman 112).
Even in a place that has the custom [to do work
