            "A Hebrew servant that is spoken of in the Torah, is a Jew that court of law sold against his will or sold himself of his own will. How so? ...", 
            "......[If someone] comes and says to you, \"Indeed I am selling myself to a gentile,\" you do not need to [help] him until he is sold. But after he is sold to the gentile, even though he transgressed and performed [something] that is not proper, it is a commandment to redeem him, and not [have him] become assimilated with them [i.e. the gentiles], as it is stated, \"after that he is sold he may be redeemed\" (Leviticus 25:48).", 
            "One who sells himself or the court of law forces him, he is not sold in public on a purchasing stone and not in an alley, as the way that slaves are sold, as it says, \"they shall not be sold as bondmen\" (Leviticus 25:42). Instead [he should be sold] privately and a manner of honor.",

            "[Regarding] people that do not behave well, it is permissible to subjugate them with force and enslave them. [If there is] a king that rules that anyone that does not give the fixed tax, [and that therefore] he is enslaved to whoever pays the tax [for him], it is permissible to use him more than necessary. But not like a [Caananite] slave. [But] if he does not behave well, it is permissible to use him as a [Caananite] slave.",

            "[Someone becomes neither] a female Hebrew servant nor a [male] Hebrew servant except when the Jubilee occurs. This occurs whether a Hebrew servant sells himself or whether a court of law sells him. We have already explained when the Jubilee was canceled."
