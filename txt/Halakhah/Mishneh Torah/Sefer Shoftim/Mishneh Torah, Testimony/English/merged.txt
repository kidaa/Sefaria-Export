Mishneh Torah, Testimony

Chapter 1

1. A witness is commanded to testify in court with of all of the relevant testimony, whether it is evidence that causes a colleague to be held liable, or testimony that vindicates him.  With regards to financial cases, this will only apply when he is called to testify. As it is written ( Leviticus 5:1), "And he should witness, see, and know (of the matter), if he does not testify, he will bear his sin."

A lunatic's testimony is invalid on a biblical [level] because he is not eligigle [to perform] Mitzvot. This [does not refer to] only to a lunatic who goes naked, breaks things, and throws stones rather anyone whose sanity is impaired and finds his intellect constantly confused on some point even if he can ask [questions] and converse on topic regarding other things. An epileptic is considered a "lunatic" during a seizure, and considered healthy at all other times, whether he is someone who gets seizures at predictable periods or the seizures happen randomly. This is only [true] if he is not always confused for there are epileptics who are mentally impaired even when not experiencing seizures. And one must consider the testimony of someone who has lots of seizures [on a case by case basis].
