On every day they [used to] remove [the ashes] from off the altar from the crowing of the rooster, either close to it, before it or after it; and on the Day of Atonement at midnight; 

Daf 8a

and on the Festivals at the first watch. The crowing of the rooster would not approach until the [Temple] court was full of Israelites.
Said R. Mana: It is not reasonable [to have the ashes removed at midnight for Yom Kippur and at the first watch for the Festivals]. But [on] Yom Kippur fro the first watch and on the Festivals from midnight, so that they shall not come into the hands of thirst. Said R. Yochanan: The removal of the ashes is the beginning of the service of the morrow, and he must sanctify his hands and feet from the laver which was sunk in water.
Originally, whosoever wanted to remove [the ashes from] the Altar, removed [it]. At a time that they were many they would run and ascend the ramp [of the altar] and he that came first into the four cubits won [the privilege]. And if two were even, the appointed one would say to them [all]: Raise the finger(s). And what did they put forward [i.e. raise]? One or two. And [but] they do not put forth [raise] the thumb in the Temple: It happened [once] that two were even, and [they] were running and ascending the ramp. And one [of them] pushed his fellow and his foot was broken. And when the court saw that they were coming into danger, they enacted that they shall not remove [the ashes from] the altar except by lot. There were four lots there, and this [one] was the first lot.
R. Manna questioned: And why did they not institute a lot for the removal of the ashes? Come and see: Slaughtering is valid with a stranger, and you say it has a lot; the removal of the ashes is prohibited [to be done] by a stranger, and you say, it has no lot? R. Manna the said again: Slaughtering is only valid by day, but the removal of the ashes is valid all night, if you say will cast a lot, even he will not arise on the doubtful [chance]. What did you see to say so? (Leviticus 6:2-3) "All the night and he shall remove [lift up]." From here [we learn] that the removal of the ashes is valid all night. A stranger [i.e. a non-priest] who removed [the ashes, what is the law]? R. Yochanan said: He is guilty [of death]. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: He is exempt. What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish? (Numbers 18:7) "A service of gift", excluding this one which is [a service of] removal. What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yochanan? (Numbers 18:7) "In everything pertaining to the altar." Rabbi Yossi bei Rabbi Bun in the name of Rav: Four
