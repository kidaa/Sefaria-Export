            "It is a positive commandment to visit the sick, comfort the mourning, to remove the dead, to bring in the bride, to escort guests, and to occupy oneself with all the needs of burial; carrying [the coffin] on one’s shoulder, to walk in front of him, to eulogize, to dig, and to bury. As well to make the bride and groom happy, and to take care of all their needs. And these are ‘Gemillut Chasadim’ that are done with one’s body, that have no measurement. Although all these are rabbinic laws they are included under \"Love Your neighbor as yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18), meaning that all things that you would like others to do for you, you should do for your brother.", 
            "The reward for accompanying [the dead] is greater than all others and it is a statute that Abraham our ancestor established and the way of the pious which he followed, feeding the travelers, and giving them drink and accompanying them.  Hospitality to guests is a greater than receiving the divine presence (Face of the Shekhinah), as it is written, \"He saw and behold there were three men (Genesis 18:3).\"  Accompanying [the dead] is greater than showing them hospitality.  The sages say, \"  All who do not accompany [the dead], it is as if they have shed blood."
