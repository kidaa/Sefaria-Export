Shir HaShirim Rabbah

Parasha 1



Perek 1

Regarding the verse that was written by Shlomo which says, "See a man that is diligent with his labor, before Kings he will stand; he will not stand before mean men." "See a man diligent with his labor", this is Joseph, as it is written about him: "And he went to the house to perform his labor(Genesis 39)." Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah...Rabbi Judah says, "It was a disgraceful day, it was a festival, a day of performances." Rabbi Nehemiah says, "It was a day of performances of the Nile River, they all went to look at it. He (Joseph) entered to perform his labor, to calculate the calculations of his Master." Rabbi Phineas says in the name of Rabbi Samuel bar Abba, "Everyone that serves his master properly, he will go out to freedom. From where do we learn this? From Joseph! Through his serving his master fittingly, he went out to freedom. Therefore, "Before kings he will stand", that is Pharoah, as it says, "And Pharoah sent, and they called Joseph and they brought him up from the pit (Genesis 41)." "He will not stand before mean men", that is Potiphar, for The Holy One Blessed Be He darkened(lit., i.e. blinded) his eyes and castrated him.
An additional meaning: "See a man diligent in his work, before kings he will stand, he will not stand before mean men." That is Moses, our teacher, regarding the work of the Tabernacle. Therefore, before kings he will stand, this is Pharoah, as it says, "Hurriedly awaken in the morning and stand before Pharoah (Exodus 8)." "He will not stand before mean men", this is Jethro. Rabbi Nehemiah said: "You have made that which is holy, profane!" Rather, "Before kings he will stand", that is King, the King of Kings, the Holy One Blessed Be He. As it is said, "And he (Moses) was there with the Lord, for 40 days (Exodus 34)." "He will not stand before mean men", that is Pharoah, as it says: "And there was dark darkness, etc. (Exodus 10)."
An additional meaning: "See a man diligent in his work, before kings he will stand, he will not stand before mean men", these are the righteous, for they are engaged in the work of The Holy One Blessed Be He. Therefore, before kings they will stand, for they will stand with the Torah. As it is stated, "By me kings shall rule (Proverbs 8)." "They will not stand before mean men", these are the wicked. As it is stated, "And their work was in the dark." Also it is written, "Let their way be dark and slippery (Psalms 35) ."
An additional meaning: "See a man diligent in his work, before kings he will stand, he will not stand before mean men", this is Rabbi Hanina. He (Rabbi Hanina) said: "Once I saw men of the city bringing up(lit., i.e offering, sacrificing) burnt-offerings and peace-offerings. I said, "All of them are bringing up peace-offerings to Jerusalem and I am not bringing up anything!? What will I do? Immediately I went out to the wilderness of the city, in the ruins of the city, and there I found one stone, I went out, cracked it, chiseled it, and polished it. He said, "Behold, it is upon me to ascend to Jerusalem." He sought to procure workers for himself. He said to them, "You (plural) bring up to me this stone to Jerusalem." He said to him, "Give us our wages", 100 gold pieces ("Zahuvim" lit. , a type of gold-based currency), and we will bring your stone up to you, to Jerusalem." He said to them, "And thus, from where will I have 100 gold pieces or 50 gold pieces to give to you all!?" And he did not find for the hour, immediately they went to them. Immediately The Holy One Blessed Be He summoned to him 5 angels, with the appearance of the men ("Sons of man" lit.). They said to him, "Our teacher/master, give to us 5 selas, and we will bring up your stone to Jerusalem, and only that you will give your hand with us. And he he gave his hand with them, and they were found standing in Jerusalem. He sought to give to them their wages, but he could not find them. The story came to the Chamber of Hewn Stone (the High Court). They said to him, "Our teacher is similar to the ministering angels, they brought up your stone to Jerusalem!" Immediately he gave to the Wise Men the wages that he was to pay with the angels.
Another explanation: "See a man diligent in his work, before kings he will stand, he will not stand before mean men," these are the words of Solomon son of David. "Before kings he will stand"--for he was diligent in the building of the First Temple. As it is written (I Kings 6): "And he built it for seven years." Another verse says (ibid): "And Solomon built his house for thirteen years." It seems that the building of Solomon's house was done more beautifully and in more quantity than the building of the Temple! Instead, they said: In the building of his own house he was lazy, but in the building of the Temple he was diligent and not lazy. Huna in the name of Rabbi Yosef said: Everyone helps the king, so even more so everyone helps for the honor of the King of Kings, the Holy One blessed be He. Even the spirits and even the demons and even the angels. Yitzchak Biryah said in the name of Rabbi Yehudah son of Rabbi Yechezkel: It is written (ibid 8) "I have built You a house of habitation", I have built a building. Rabbi Berechiah said: "The house that they were building" is not written here, rather "the building in its state of having been built," so it seems that it had been built. As it says (ibid 6): "was built of stone made at the quarry." "Banui (recently built) is not written, rather "nivneh" (was built). This teaches that the stone carried itself.

It is like a king, who said that he is coming on a particular day, and the people slept on the night before the king arrived. He found them sleeping and sounded trumpets to wake them up..So too the people of Israel slept all of  the night before the giving of the torah...

Perek 2

As a lily among the thorns.  Rabbi Yitzchak applied this reading to Rebekah, as it is said (Genesis 25), "And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Betuel, the Aramean, from Paddan Aram, the sister of Lavan, the Aramean, etc," If it wants to teach that she was from Paddan Aram, why does the text say 'sister of Lavan the Aramean'?  Rather, it is to tell us that her father was a trickster, her brother was a trickers and the inhabitants of that place were tricksters and that this righteous one came from their midst.  To what can she be compared?  Like a lily among the thorns.  Rabbi Pinchas in the name of Rabbi Simon said, "It is written (Genesis 28), 'And Yitzchak sent Yaakov to Paddan Aram to Lavan, son of Betuel, the Aramean, grouping all of them as tricksters.

"Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots" (Song of Songs 6:12). R. Hiyya taught: This can be compared to a princess who was collecting fallen sheaves. The king passed by and recognized that she was his daughter, so he sent his friend to take her and seat her with him in his carriage. Her friends were astonished by her and said, "Yesterday you were collecting fallen sheaves and today you sit in a carriage with the king?!" She said to them, "Just as you are astonished by me, so too am I astonished by myself!" And she applied to herself the verse, "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]." So too, when Israel was in Egypt, forced to work with mortar and bricks, and considered disgusting and worthless in the eyes of the Egyptians. Then, when they became free, were redeemed, and were made into the rulers of the whole world, the nations of the world were astonished and said, "Yesterday you were slaves working with mortar and bricks and today you've become free and rulers over the entire world?!" And Israel said to them, "Just as you are astonished by us, so too are we astonished by us!" And they applied to themselves the verse, "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]." Another interpretation: "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]." The Scriptures refer to Joseph the righteous. Yesterday "they bound his feet with fetters; his body with iron" (Ps. 105:18), and today "and Joseph was governor over the entire land" (Gen. 42:6). And he applied to himself the verse, "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]." Another interpretation: "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]" refers to David. Yesterday he fled from Saul, and today he is King David, so he applied to himself the verse, "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]." Another interpretation: "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]." Scripture refers to Mordecai. Yesterday "He wore sackcloth and ash" (Esther 4:1), and today "Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in the royal garments of blue and white..." (ibid. 8:15). And he applied to himself the verse, "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]." Another interpretation: "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]." Scripture refers to the Congregation of Israel. The Congregation of Israel said to the nations of the world, "Do not rejoice over me; I have fallen, but I will rise" (Micah 7:8), because during the time when I dwelt in darkness, the Holy One of Blessing brought me into the light, as it is said, "Though I sit in darkness, the Eternal is my light." And she applied to herself the verse, "Before I was aware, she set me [upon the most lavish of chariots]."
