Verse 1

It is taught in Seder Olam that in the 27th year of Jeraboam, Azariah was afflicted with Leprosy and he reigned an afflicted kingdom. However, the beginning of Azariah's reign began in the same year Jeraboam began to rule. (NOT DONE)

Verse 4



Verse 5

In Chronicles it says that Azariah came to the Beit Hamikdash out of anger with the priests and gave incense despite the priests' objections.
As if to say, he resigned as leader of the kingdom, and was exempt from work. And this is like what our rabbis say, may they be remembered for a blessing, that kingship is like slavery because of the large amount of work required.
he was appointed over the palace as a judge who judged the nation in place of the king.

Verse 7



Verse 8

Jeroboam was king 3 years in the life of his father and 38 years after the death of his father, in total 41 years. His term ended in the 38th year of Azariah, because the beginning of Azariah's reign  during his father's reign and the beginning of Jeraboam's reign from the death of his father happened at the same time. If so, Jeraboam reigned for three years prior to the reign of Azariah in his father's life, and he ruled in his 41st year during the 38th year of Azariah's reign, and then Zechariah took over.

On the matter that the guards of Tiphsah did not open the gates of the city to gain entry to it. This is the reason he smote Tiphsah and it's borders that were across Tirzah.

Verse 17

Because Zechariah reigned for 38 years during Uziah's reign, and he reigned for 6 more months, and Shalum reigned during the 39th year of Uziah.
It wanted to say, after 39 years passed at Azariah, Shallum reigned at the end of Azariah's 39th year and was killed after a month. And in the next year at the end of Azariah's 39th year and the beginning of the 40th year Menachem ruled.
