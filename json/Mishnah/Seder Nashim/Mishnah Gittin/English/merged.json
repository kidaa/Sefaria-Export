            "One who brings a bill of divorce from overseas must say, \"[This document] was written and signed in my presence.\" Rabban Gamliel says, \"[This statement must be made] even [when it was brought] from Rekem and Cheger.\" Rabbi Elazar says, \"Even from Kefar Luddim to Lydda.\" And the Sages say, \"Only one who brings the bill of divorce from overseas or one who brings it there must say, 'It was written and signed in my  presence.'\" And one who brings [a bill of divorce] from one province to another, in an overseas land must say,  'It was written and signed in my  presence.'\" Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, \"Even from [one] district to [another] district.\"", 
            "Rabbi Yehudah says, \"From Rekem to the East and Rekem is like the East; from Ashkelon to the South and Ashkelon is like the South; from Acco to the North and Acco is like the North.\" Rabbi Meir says, \"Acco is like Eretz Yisrael with regard to bills of divorce.\"", 
            "[With regard to] one who brings a bill of divorce within Eretz Yisrael, he need not say, \"It was written and signed in my presence.\" If there are any objectors [to its validity], [its validity] must be upheld by [confirming the signatures of] its signatories. [With regard to] one who brings a bill of divorce from overseas, and is not able to say,  \"It was written and signed in my presence,\" [its validity] must be upheld by [confirming the signatures of] its signatories.", 
            "Both bills of divorce of women and deeds of manumission for slaves, are alike with regard to one who brings them from, or brings them to [a distant land]. And this is one of the ways in which [the laws of] bills of divorce and deeds of manumission are alike.", 
            "Any document that bears [the signature of] a Samaritan witness, is invalid, except for bills of divorce and deeds of manumission. It once happened that they brought a bill of divorce to Rabban Gamaliel in Kefar Otnai, and its [signed] witnesses were Samaritans, and he declared it valid. Any document brought to secular courts, even if their signatories are non-Jews, are valid, except for bills of divorce and deeds of manumission. Rabbi Shimon says, \"Even these are valid; [the exceptions] were mentioned only when they were prepared unofficially [i.e., outside of the official court system].",

These are the words of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say, \"[That this is only allowable] with [regard to] bills of divorce for women, but not with deeds of manumission, because it we may confer an advantage upon a person in his absence, but we may not confer upon him any disadvantage, except in his presence; for, if a person wants not to feed his slave, he may do so, but not to feed his wife, he may not.\" [Rabbi Meir] said to them: \"Does he not disqualify his slave from [eating] <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] just as he disqualifies his wife?\" [The Sages] said to him, \"It is because the slave is his acquisition.\" [With regard to] one who says, \"Give this bill of divorce to my wife, and this deed of manumission to my slave,\" and he dies [before it was delivered], they may not be delivered [to the parties mentioned] after [his] death.

One may not write [it] with a drink, nor with fruit juice, nor with any impermanent material. One may write [it] on anything: on an olive leaf; on a cow's horn, but he must give her the cow; on the hand of a slave, but he must give her the slave. Rabbi Yossi HaGelili says, \"One may not write on anything that has the spirit of life, nor on foods.\" ", 
            "One may not write [it] on anything that is attached to the ground. [If] one wrote it on something attached, [and] he detached it and signed it and gave it to her, it is valid.

But [if he] was hearing, and became deaf and then recovered his hearing; or he was seeing, and he became blind, and then recovered his sight; or a mentally competent person, and he became a <i>shoteh</i>, and then became mentally competent again, it is valid.

What is the difference between [testifying about] a bill of divorce and [about] death? Because [with regard to the bill of divorce] the writing, [i.e., the bill itself,] proves [the testimony to be accurate].

            "Every bill of divorce which is not written for a particular woman is invalid. How so? If one was passing through the market and he heard the voice of the scribes saying, \"So-and-so divorces So-and-so from Such-and-such a place,\" and he said [to himself], \"That is my name and that is the name of my wife,\" it is invalid to divorce [his wife] with that [bill of divorce]. Moreover, if one wrote [a  bill of divorce] with which to divorce his wife, and he changed his mind, and a fellow townsman found him and said to him, \"My name is the same as your name and my wife's name is the same as your wife's name,\" the bill of divorce is invalid [for the latter] to divorce [his wife] with it. Moreover, if one had two wives,and their names are the same, if he wrote a  bill of divorce to divorce the elder, he may not use it to divorce the younger. Moreover, if one says to a scribe, \"Write a  bill of divorce, so that I may divorce whichever one I desire,\" it is invalid to divorce with it. ", 
            "[With regard to] one who writes blank forms of bills of divorce must leave space [for the insertion of the name of] the husband and space [for the name of] the wife, and space for the date. In blank forms of loan contracts one must leave space for [the insertion of] the lender's [name], space for the borrower's [name], space for the [amount] of money, and space for the date. In forms of deeds of sale, one must leave space for [the insertion of the name of] the buyer and space for the seller, and space for the purchase money, space for [the description of] the field [sold], and space for the date. [This is all] due to the [special] enactment. Rabbi Yehudah disqualifies all [blank forms]. Rabbi Elazar considers them all valid, with the exception of a  bill of divorce, because it is stated (Deuteronomy 24:1), \"He shall write unto her [a bill of divorce],\" [indicating] for her in particular.",

[With regard to] one who brings a  bill of divorce and left [the husband when he was] elderly or ill, he may deliver it to her on the presumption that he is still alive. [With regard to] a daughter of an Israelite who was married to a Kohen and her husband went overseas, she may eat <i>terumah</i> [a portion of a crop given to a Kohen which becomes holy upon separation, and can only be consumed by Kohanim or their household] on the presumption that her husband is alive. [With regard to] one who sends his sin-offering from overseas [to the Temple], they may offer it, on the presumption that he is alive.", 
            "There were three things that Rabbi Elazar ben Partah said before the Sages, and they confirmed his words: With regard to a city that was besieged by soldiers, and with regard to a ship that was caught in [turbulent] seas, and with regard to one who is taken out to be tried [for a capital crime]; [in each case] they are presumed to be alive. However, with regard to a city that had been captured by soldiers, or a ship that was lost at sea and one who was taken out to be killed, we place upon him the stringencies of those who are alive and the stringencies of those who are dead; [neither the] a daughter of an Israelite who married a Kohen nor a daughter of a Kohen who married an Israelite may eat <i>terumah</i>.

            "[With regard to] one who brought a bill of divorce within Eretz Yisrael, and he fell ill, he may send it in the hands of another [messenger]; however, if the husband had said, \"Bring me [back] from her a certain item,\" he may not send it with another, because [it is clear that] it is not [the husband's] will that his item will be in another's hands.

If they died [before the debt was paid] he must obtain the consent of their heirs [to make this deduction], but if he lent the money in the presence of the court this is unnecessary.",

If they were lost, he must always be concerned [retroactively from the discovery of the loss] for twenty four hours.  These are the words of Rabbi Elezar ben Shamua. Rabbi Yehudah says, \"They must check the wine [for spoilage] at three periods [of the year]: when the eastern winds begin to blow after the Feast of Tabernacles, when the fruit of the grape vine has set, and when the unripe grapes begin to be juicy.\""

If the husband preceded the messenger [in getting] to the woman, or if he sent [a second] messenger, and he said to her, \"The bill of divorce that I sent you is cancelled,\" then it is cancelled.

            "At first, a man [who had already sent his wife a bill of divorce by means of a messenger] would set up a religious court in a different place [from where the wife lived] and cancel [the bill of divorce].  Rabban Gamliel the Elder enacted that they not be able to do this, due to [the need for] repairing the world [<i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>].  At first, a man could change his name and her name, the name of his city, or the name of her city.   Rabban Gamliel the Elder enacted that one would write: \"The man, So-and-so, and any other name that he has, and the woman, So-and-so, and any other name that she has,\" due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i>.",

If [he was ransomed] to be a free man, he may not be enslaved. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: \"Either way he may be enslaved.\" [With regard to] a slave whose master mortgaged him to others, and then freed him, the baseline law is that the slave is not obligated at all. However, due to <i>Tikkun HaOlam</i> they force his [second] master to free him, and [the slave must] write a document [of debt] for his money's worth to him.

[To marry] a free-woman is impossible, for he is half-slave.

It once happened that a healthy person said, \"Write a bill of divorce for my wife,\" and then went on his roof, and he fell and died. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, \"The Sages said, 'If he fell on his own [i.e., purposely], it is a [valid] bill of divorce; if the wind pushed him, it is not a [valid] bill of divorce.\"", 
            "If one says to two [men], \"Give a bill of divorce to my wife,\" or to three, \"Write a bill of divorce, and give it to my wife,\" they shall write, and give it [to her]. If he said to three, \"Give a bill of divorce to my wife,\" the latter [may] tell others to write it, because he made them a tribunal; these are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Hanina of Ono brought this law with him from prison, [as he said]: \"I have received a tradition, that when he said to three, 'Give my wife a bill of divorce,' that they may tell others to write it, because he them a tribunal.\" Rabbi Yossi said, \"We said to the messenger, We [also] have a tradition, that even if he said to the High Court in Jerusalem, 'Give my wife a bill of divorce,' that they must learn [the procedures of a bill of divorce], write a bill of divorce, and give it [to her].\" If he said to ten [men], \"Write a bill of divorce for my wife,\" one of them shall write, and two [shall] sign it; [but if he said], \"Write it all of you,\" then one shall write, and all [shall] sign it. Therefore, if one of them should die, the bill of divorce becomes void."

            "If a person seized with Cardiacos should say, \"Write a bill of divorce for my wife,\" his words are not to be noticed. If he said [before he was taken ill], \"Write a bill of divorce for my wife,\" and when seized with the Cardiacos, he said, \"Do not write it,\" his last words are not to be noticed. When a person became dumb, and on being asked, \"Shall we write a bill of divorce  for your wife?\" nods his head [in token of assent], he shall be questioned three times, and if he [by his motions or gestures] answers rightly the questions proposed to him, both affirmative and negative, they may in that case write a bill of divorce and deliver it to his wife.", 
            "If a person [in health, or a sick person acquainted with the Law] is asked, \"Shall we write a Get for your wife?\" and he answered, \"Write it;\" and they ordered the notary in consequence, who wrote it, and the witnesses, who signed it: although it was duly written, attested and delivered to the husband, who delivered it to his wife, nevertheless it is ineffective, because it is only then valid when the husband himself orders the notary to write, and the witnesses to attest it.", 
            "[When a husband says to his wife] \"This is your Get in case I die,\" or, \"If I die of this illness,\" or, \"To take effect after my decease,\" his words are vain; but if he said, \"Here is your Get, to take effect from this day,\" or, \"from this moment, if I should die,\" it is a valid Get. If he said, \"To take effect from this day and after my death,\" it is doubtful whether such Get is valid or not: and in case he dies [without leaving issue], his widow must perform the ceremony of Chalitzah to her brother-in-law, but the latter may not marry her by Yeboom.  If he said, \"This is your Get from this day if I die of this illness,\" and he rose [from his sick bed], went out into the street, and became ill again and died: if he died in consequence of a relapse of the former illness the Get is valid, but not otherwise.", 
            "Under the mentioned circumstances  the wife may not meet the husband but in the presence of witnesses. A slave or a bondwoman is a competent witness for this purpose, her own bondwoman excepted, because a mistress is usually quite familiar with such a one. How is she to be considered during that interval? According to R. Jehudah, \"As a married woman in every respect,\" but according to R. José, \"As one whose divorce is doubtful.\"", 
            "If he [a husband] says, \"Here is your Get, on condition that you give me two hundred zooz,\" she is divorced from the moment she accepts the Get, and is bound to pay the stipulated amount. If he said, \"On condition that you give me [two hundred zooz, or any other sum] within thirty days,\" and she consented and paid the amount agreed upon within the time stipulated, she is duly divorced, but not if she did not pay it within that time. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel relates, \"That once at Sidon a husband said to his wife, 'Here is your Get, on condition that you give me my ‏אצטלית‎,' and she lost it: the sages decided that the Get should be still valid, if she paid him a sum equal to the value thereof.\"", 
            "If a husband says to his wife, \"Here is your Get, on condition that you wait on my father,\" or \"suckle my child\" [the period allowed for the general duration of suckling a child is two years]. What period is she bound to suckle it? R. Jehudah saith, \"Eighteen months only, and if during that period the child or the father should die, the Get is valid.\" If he said, \"Here is your Get, on condition that you wait on my father for two years,\" or \"suckle my child two years,\" and either the child or the father dies, or that the latter refuses her services, without being angry with her, the Get is not valid: but Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel considers it valid under the mentioned circumstances, for he establishes it as a rule \"That every impediment which does not proceed from the part of the wife does not render the Get void.\"", 
            "Should a husband say to his wife, \"Here is your Get if I do not return within thirty days,\" and intending to travel from Judea into Galilee he returned after having proceeded to Antipatris only, he has voided his condition. If he said, \"Here is thy Get if I do not return within thirty days,\" and intending to travel from Judea to Galilee returns from the village Otenai, he has voided his condition. If he said, \"Here is thy Get if I do not return within thirty days,\" and intending to travel beyond sea he went only as far as Acco and returned, he has voided his condition. If he said, \"Here is thy Get if at any time I should stay away for thirty days from thee,\" though he should frequently go and return for that period, the Get is valid, provided he did not remain alone with her.", 
            "When a husband said to his wife, \"Here is thy Get if I do not return within a twelve-month,\" and he died within that twelvemonth, the Get is void; but if he said, \"This is thy Get from the present moment, if I do not return within a twelvemonth from this day,\" and he died within that time, the Get is valid.", 
            "When a husband said, \"If I do not return within a twelvemonth from this day, write ye, and deliver a Get to my wife;\" if they wrote it within the twelve-month, but did not deliver it till after that time, the Get is void. If he said, \"Write ye, and deliver a Get to my wife if I do not return within a twelve-month from this day;\" if they wrote it within that time, but did not deliver it till after the expiration thereof, the Get is void. R. José saith, \"It is valid in similar cases.\" If they wrote and delivered it after the expiration of the twelve-month, and the husband died meanwhile; if the delivery of the Get preceded the death of the husband, the Get is valid, but not if posterior to that event; and where it cannot be ascertained which event was prior to the other, she is to be considered as one whose divorce is doubtful."
