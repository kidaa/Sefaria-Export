Onkelos Genesis

Chapter 1

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
And the earth was desolate and empty, and darkness came off the face of the water, and a wind from God blew over the face of the water.
And God said, "Let light be", and light was.
And God saw the light, that it was good, and separated the light from the darkness.
 And God called the light "day" and the darkness he called "light".  It was evening and it was morning; day one.
And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, separating between water and water".
 And God made the expanse, and separated the water below the expanse from the water above the expanse; and it was so.
 And God called the expanse "the heavens".  And it was evening and it was morning; day two.
 And God said, "Let water gather under the skies to one place, exposing land, and it was so.
 And God called the land "earth", and to the gathering of the water he called "seas", and God saw that it was good.

Chapter 2

...And they were finished, the heavens, the earth, and all their hosts.
...And God ended on the seventh day his work that he did, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he did.
...And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because on it he rested from all of his work that God created to do.
