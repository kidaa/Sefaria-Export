.......Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, forty days did Moshe spend on the mountain - he read the doctrine of Scripture during the day and reviewed the doctrine of Scripture at night. And after forty days, he took the tablets and went down to the camp, and on the seventeenth of Tammuz he broke the tablets and killed the scorners of Israel. And he spent forty days in the camp, until he he burned the [golden] calf and ground it down like the dust of the earth, and killed all those who kissed the calf he expunged idol worship from Israel; and he set every tribe up in its place. And on Rosh Chodesh (the beginning of the month of) Elul, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (Exodus 24:12), "go up to Me to the mountain." And they blew the <i>shofar</i> (rams's horn) in the camp - since behold, Moshe went up to the mountain - such that they not err again after the worship of idols. And the Holy One, blessed be He, was exalted on that day with that <i>shofar</i> [blast], as it is stated (Psalms 47:6), "God is exalted by the <i>shofar</i>." And therefore, the Sages, ordained that we should blow the <i>shofar</i> on Rosh Chodesh Elul in each and every year....
