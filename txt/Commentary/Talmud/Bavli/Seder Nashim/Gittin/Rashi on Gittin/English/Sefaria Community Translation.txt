And this stumbling block - meaning, so began the discourse on scripture, it is written "this stumbling block [ruin] under your hand" regarding the men of Jerusalem for whom Torah had ceased, and they were asking their friends "you have a mantle, be our ruler, and this ruin should be under your hand", that is to say, these things that are opaque like your mantle, you that are an expert on them, tell us [what to do] and be a ruler. And this stumbling block are the words of Torah, that a person does not have a firm standing on their truth unless he stumbles on them, to teach mistakes and be humiliated by them, and then one pays attention and understands. Under your hand they are - even I stumbled in my teaching and retracted [what I said].




















Rather, Raba said: Just as [in the case that] if one affiances half a woman, she is not affianced, so [too in this case] if a woman who is half a slave and half free is affianced, her betrothal is no betrothal. Rabah son of Rav Huna said in a discourse: Just as if a man affiances half a woman she is not affianced, so if a woman who is half a slave and half free is affianced, she is not really betrothed! Said R. Hisda to him: Are the two cases [really] similar? In the one [the man] leaves something over from his acquisition, in the other he leaves nothing over from his acquisition. Rabbah son of R. Huna thereupon called upon a public orator, who discoursed as follows: 'This stumbling-block is under thy hand (Isaiah 3:6).  A man does not fully understand the words of the Torah until he has come to stumble over them.  Although they have said that if a man affiances half a woman she is not affianced, yet if one who is half a slave and half free is affianced, her betrothal is a genuine one. What is the reason [for the difference]? In the one case he leaves something over from his acquisition, in the other case he leaves nothing over from his acquisition.' But R. Sheshet [disagreed and] said: Just as if a man affiances half a woman she is not affianced, so if a woman who is half a slave and half free is affianced, her betrothal is not a genuine one.
