Likutei Moharan

Torah 1

Happy are the ones on the wholehearted path, who walk in HaShem's Torah. (Psalms 119:1)
Acknowledge because by way of the Torah all prayers and requests  that we request and and pray are accepted.  And Yisrael's favor and importance are raised and elevated before whoever they need whether spiritually or materialistically.  Because now in our many transgressions Yisrael's real favor and importance descended, because now the importance and favor are mainly by them, but through the Torah Yisrael's favor and importance are raised because the Torah is called (Proverbs 5) AYeLeT AHaVIM VYAALaT HeN/Favor, that raises/SHeiMAALaH HeN/favor upon her studiers (Eruvin 54:b); through this all prayers and requests are raised.
