            "These are the things that have no set amount: the peah, the bikkurim, the r'iyah, charity, and learning Torah. Peah has a minimum amount but does not have a maximum amount. [If] one makes his entire field peah, it is not peah.", 
            "These are the things that are [constantly] subtracting from a person['s ultimate reward] in this world while the principal remains for him in the world to come: idolatry, sexual perversion, and murder; and slander is equal to all of them.", 
            "A good deed has immediate and future benefit, as it is stated (Isaiah 3:10), \"Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.\" A transgression has immediate damage but no future damage [for the transgressor], as it is stated (Isaiah 3:11), \"Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for the work of his hands shall be done to him.\" How, then, am I to understand \"[The wicked] shall eat of the fruit of their own way\" (Proverbs 1:31)? Rather, when a transgression damages, it has immediate damage, and when it does not damage, it has no immediate damage.", 
            "A good thought [Hashem] combines to action; a bad thought Hashem does not combine to action, as it is stated, \"If I had regarded iniquity in my heart [the Lord would not hear].\" How, then, am I to understand \"Behold I am bringing evil, fruit of your thoughts?\" Rather, a good thought that does good Hashem combines to action, and that which does not do good Hashem does not combine to action.", 
            "A person gives Peah (corners of the field) from the beginning of the field, and in the middle [of the field], and in the end [of the field]. But if he gave either [only] in the beginning [of the field], or [only] in the middle [of the field], or [only] in the end [of the field], he has fulfilled his obligation [of giving Peah to the poor]. Rebbi Shimon says, “If he gave either [only] in the beginning [of the field], or [only] in the middle [of the field], or [only] in the end [of the field] it is considered to be Peah, but he [still] needs to give the proper amount [of Peah] in the end [of the field].” Rebbi Yehuda says, “If he left [at least] one stalk [in the end of the field,] he can add to it [from other parts of the field to make up the minimum amount and] it counts for him as Peah. But if [he did] not [leave even one stalk at the end of the field] he only gives [what he left in the beginning and the middle of the field [to the poor] as ownerless [produce, but not as Peah].” Rebbi Yehuda said, “When do we say this [that he can add the produce in the end of the field to the produce left in other parts of the field and all of it counts as Peah]? At the time that he [actually] gave Peah [by leaving at least one stock in the end of the field] and then he wants to add [to it more produce from other parts of the field].”", 
            "[If a person] did not give [Peah] (corners of the field) from standing crops he can give it from the sheaves. [But even if] he did not give [Peah] from the sheaves, he can [still] give it from the heap of sheaves. [But even if] he did not give [Peah] from the heap of sheaves, he can [still] give it from the pile [of grain] as long as he did not even it out. But if he [already] evened out[the pile of grain then] he takes off the tithes and [only after that] gives [Peah].", 
            "Rebbi Shimon said, “Because of four things the Torah said [that] a person should only give Peah (corners of the field) in the end of his field [and not in the middle or in the beginning relative to where he began to harvest from]. Because of theft from the poor, and because of wasting time of the poor, and because of suspicion, and because of cheaters. How so because of theft from the poor? That [the owner] should not see a time when there are no people there and he will say to a poor person who is his relative, ‘Come and take this Peah for yourself.’ And how so because of wasting time of the poor? That the poor will not sit and watch [the field] the whole day and say, ‘Now he is giving Peah, now he is giving Peah’, but rather since [the owner] gives it in the end [of his harvest of the field, the poor person will] go and do his work, and [then] come and take [Peah] in the end [of his work day]. And how so because of suspicion? That passersby should not say, ‘Look at so and so that he harvested his field and did not leave from it Peah, because so it says in the Torah, ‘You should not harvest the corners of your field …’ (Leviticus 19:9, Leviticus 23:22)’ And how so because of cheaters? That people should not say, ‘We already gave [Peah].’ Another explanation. That he should not leave the good [portion of the crops for himself] and give [Peah] from the bad [portion of the crops].”", 
            "Even though a vegetable is gathered at one time it is not subject to storage. But figs, even though they are subject to storage, they are not gathered at one time.", 
            "Rebbi Yossi Ben Rebbi Yehuda says, “Rutab dates are exempt from Peah (corners of the field), because the first [of the fruit] does not wait for the last [of the fruit].” Rebbi Elazar Ben Rebbi Tzadok says, “Jujubes are obligated in Peah.” Others say, “Even Stone pine and blue sweet peas [are obligated in Peah as well].”", 
            "These [landmarks] interrupt [the field] regarding Peah (corners of the field) [and obligate the owner to give Peah again from the second half of the field]: a stream, a water reservoir, a private road, a public road, a private path, a permanent public path [regardless if it was established] in the summer time or in the winter time, [a section of] fallow land, [a section of] newly broken land, [a section with] a different [type of planted] seed [than the rest of the field], [a section of] harvested [land] for [the purpose of] destruction [of the produce prior to its ripening], three ridges of a furrowed field, and a ditch with water [that is wide enough that both sides of it] cannot be harvested simultaneously [by standing on one side of it and harvesting the opposite side]. Rebbi Yehuda says, “If [a person must] stand in the middle [of the ditch even if it is without water in order that] he [is able to] harvest on this [side of the ditch] and on the opposite [side of the ditch, then it] interrupts [the field with regard to Peah], but if [he does] not [need to stand in the middle of the ditch in order to harvest on both sides of it, then the ditch does] not interrupt [the field with regard to Peah].” [If a section of the field] was eaten by grasshoppers, was eaten by locusts, was plucked by ants, was broken by wind or animals, everyone agrees that [if afterwards it was] ploughed over [then] it interrupts [the field with regard to Peah], but if [afterwards] it was not [ploughed over, but rather was left as it was after the damage, then] it does not interrupt [the field with regard to Peah].", 
            "[If a person] harvested [only] half [of his field, and not the whole field] and [then he] sold what he has harvested, [or] he harvested [only] half [of his field, and not the whole field] and [then he] sanctified (i.e. donated to the Bet Hamikdash (Temple)) what he has harvested, he gives Peah (corners of the field) from what [crops] remain [in the field] for everything [including what he already sold or sanctified.]", 
            "[If there is produce planted on top of ground in the shape of] steps that are ten Tefachim (handbreadths) high, [then the farmer must] give Peah (corners of the field) from each [step separately]. But if the tops of rows [of produce] are mixed up [and are not evenly leveled one above the other then the farmer must] give Peah from one [row] for everything.", 
            "[A farmer] who selectively picks [some produce from his field early for immediate sale and leaves the remaining produce to ripen further for storage] is obligated [to leave Peah (corners of the field)] in the beginning [after he picks some of the produce for immediate sale] and [also] he is obligated [to leave Peah] in the end [after he harvests the remaining produce for storage]. [If a farmer] had [in his vineyard only] four or five grape vines, [and then] he harvested them and brought [the harvested grapes] inside his house [in order to eat them, and not inside the wine press in order to press them into wine], he is exempt from [leaving] Peret (individual fallen grapes), from [leaving] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), from [leaving] Peah (corners of the field), but he is obligated in [leaving] Olelot (incompletely formed grape clusters). [However,] if [after the farmer brought some grapes into his house to eat, he also] left [more grapes in the vineyard in order to press them into wine] he gives [Peah] from what has remained [in the vineyard] for that which he has left [there to be pressed into wine, but not for what he already brought into his house to eat, because that part is exempt from Peah]. And [a farmer] who plucks (thins) [some grapes from the vineyard in order to give the remaining grapes more room to grow does not leave any Peah from the plucked grapes, but rather] he gives [Peah only] from what has remained [in the vineyard] for that which he has left [there to be pressed into wine]. Rebbi Yehuda said, “When do we say that [that the farmer only gives Peah from what he has left in the vineyard for only that which he has left to be pressed into wine later, and not for what he has plucked]? When [the farmer] plucked [the grapes] in [order to sell them on] the market. But [if] he plucked [them in order to eat them] inside his house [and not sell them] he has to give [Peah] from what has remained [in the vineyard] for everything, [including what he has left to be pressed into wine and what he has plucked in order to eat himself.]”", 
            "[A farmer] who plucks [the produce and does not harvest it in the normal manner or for the main purpose of harvesting that produce] and brings it inside his house [and not inside the storage silo], even [if he has done so to] his whole field, is exempt from [leaving] Leket (fallen stalks), from [leaving] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), and from [leaving] Peah (corners of the field), but he is obligated in [taking of] Maaserot (tithes).", 
            "[A person who is either dangerously ill or healthy,] writes away [in a contract all of] his [movable and immovable] property to his sons and [also] writes away [in the same contract] to his wife land of any size – [the wife] loses [the right to claim the value of] her Ketubah (marriage contract) [upon the husband’s death or divorce]. Rebbi Yossi said, “When do we say this [that the wife loses the right to claim the value of her Ketubah upon the husband’s death or divorce]? At the time when she accepted upon herself [to receive this land] as a part of her Ketubah. But if she did not accept upon herself [to receive this land] as a part of her Ketubah, whatever [the husband] gave her [is considered to be] given [to her as a regular gift] and she [can still] claim her Ketubah [upon his death or divorce] from [his] other property [that he gave away to his sons in the above mentioned contract].”", 
            "[A person who is either dangerously ill or healthy, ] writes away [in a contract all of] his [movable and immovable] property to his [non‐ Jewish] slave, [the slave] goes out a free person. [But] if [the owner] left [for himself] land of any size, [then the slave] does not go out a free person. Rebbi Shimon says, “[A person] who says, ‘All of my [movable and immovable] property is given to so and so, my slave, except for [this] one of many thousands [of items] among them,’ [it is as if] he did not say anything [and the slave does not go out free, but rather remains his slave]. [But if a person said that he is giving all of his movable and immovable property to his slave, ‘except for a particular city, [or] except for a particular field’, even though there is no [anything else] there except for that field or that city (i.e. the owner did not have any other possessions anyway) this slave has acquired the [only other] property [of that person] (i.e. himself) and [therefore] acquired himself [to go out as a] free person.” And when [these] words [of Rebbi Shimon] were said in front of Rebbi Yossi, he said “Lips will kiss the one who replies straight things.” (Proverbs 24:26)"

            "[If a poor worker] received [a one time job] to harvest a field, [then] his son cannot glean [the gifts to the poor right] after him [before other poor people will have a chance to glean that field]. Rebbi Yossi says, “His son may glean after him.” But sharecroppers, and [regular] tenants, and a person who sells his standing crops to his friend in order [that his friend should] harvest them, [in all of these cases] his (i.e. the sharecropper’s, or tenant’s, or friend’s) son can glean [the gifts to the poor right] after him [before other poor people will have a chance to glean that field]. If there were [in the field] poor people who are not fitting [to be allowed] to glean [the gifts to the poor, then] if the owner of the field can prevent them [from gleaning], he is allowed to do so, but if [he is] not [able to prevent them from gleaning, then] he should leave them alone [and let them glean anyway] because of peaceful relations [between people].", 
            "We do not hire Non-Jewish workers [to harvest the fields], because they are not well versed in [leaving] Leket (fallen stalks), [Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), and Peah (corners of the field)].", 
            "We do not give Maaser Ani (Tithe of the Poor) to Non-Jewish poor people, but we do give them Chulin (ordinary) [food], which has been tithed [instead of the Maaser Ani] as a nice gesture.", 
            "[If] the owner [of the field] was standing in the city and he said, “I know that [my] workers are forgetting a sheaf in such and such a place [in the field],” and they (i.e. workers) [really] forgot it [there, then] it is not [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [because the owner still knows about it and did not forget it]. Rebbi Shimon Ben Yehuda says in the name of Rebbi Shimon, “Even if other people were passing by on the road [next to the field] and they saw the sheaf that they (i.e. workers) have forgotten, it is not [considered to be] Shikcha until it gets forgotten by all people, [including the passersby.]”", 
            "Rebbi Yehuda says, “A person who made his whole field into sheaves [in order to later] stook them [into stooks, which in turn will be taken to the final stack] is [considered to be] like someone who bundles [sheaves] in [order to put them in a] stack [of sheaves, which makes the sheaves inside the stooks eligible to become Shikcha (forgotten sheaves),] and [then] rounded it (i.e. the stack) out [as if he has completed the stack] and [then brought more sheaves and] pressed [them] into the stack [after the stack seemed to be already finished, which is still considered to be the final act of bundling, which makes these sheaves eligible to become Shikcha].”", 
            "Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel agree that if [a person] proclaimed [his produce to be] ownerless [only] to people, but not to animals, [or only] to Jews, but not to Non-Jews, [it is still considered to be] ownerless [and anyone can come and take it].", 
            "Rebbi Ilai said, “I asked Rebbi Yehoshua, ‘Regarding which sheaves Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel argue [whether they are considered to be Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) or not]?’ He said to me, ‘[I swear] by this Torah [that they argue]’ regarding a sheaf [that is left in the field] next to a hedge, or [next to] a stack, [or next to] cattle [used for plowing], or [next to plowing] tools, and it was forgotten [there by the farmer].’ And when I came and asked Rebbi Eliezer, he said to me, ‘They agree by all of these [cases that Rebbi Yehoshua mentioned] that it is not [considered to be] Shikcha. [So] what [case] do they argue about? Regarding a sheaf that [the farmer] took [with him] to bring to the city and put it on the side of a stone fence or on the side of a hedge [in order to take a break], and forgot it [there], that Bet Shammai say that it is not [considered to be] Shikcha, because he [already] acquired it [for himself], and Bet Hillel say [that it is considered to be] Shikcha.’ And when I came and proclaimed [these] words [of Rebbi Eliezer] in front of Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah he said to me, ‘[I swear] by the Torah, these are the words that were spoken to Moshe on Sinai.’”", 
            "[If a farmer] took a sheaf in order to take it to the city, and [then] he put [this sheaf] down [on the ground] on top of his friend (i.e. another sheaf) [while still in the field] and [then] he forgot both of them [in the field where he put them down], then the bottom [sheaf] is [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaf), and the top [sheaf] is not [considered to be] Shikcha. Rebbi Shimon says, “Both of them are not [considered to be] Shikcha. The bottom [sheaf is not considered to be Shikcha], because it is covered [by the top sheaf], and the top [sheaf is not considered to be Shikcha], because [the farmer] acquired it [for himself].”", 
            "[If a farmer] stooked [some] sheaves in a field in which sheaves have been [laid out in a] mixed [fashion], and forgot one [of the sheaves, then this sheaf] is not [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), until he stooks all of the [other sheaves] around it.", 
            "What is [the case mentioned in the Mishna titled as] “a sheaf that is in front of it proves [that it is not considered to be Shikcha”]? Someone who had 10 rows [of sheaves with] 10 sheaves in each row, and he stooked one of [the rows in the direction] from North to South, and [then] forgot [the last sheaf in that row.] It is not [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaf), because [that sheaf] can be counted [as a part of the last row that goes] from East to West.", 
            "Two gavels separated from one another are [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [but] three [gavels] are not [considered to be] Shikcha. Two sheaves separated from one another are [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [but] three [sheaves] are not [considered to be] Shikcha. Two grapevines separated from one another (i.e. from separate tree trunks) are [considered to be] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves), [but] three [grapevines] are not [considered to be] Shikcha. Two [grape] berries [lying next to each other on the ground] are [considered to be] Peret (individual fallen grapes), [but] three [grape berries lying next to each other on the ground] are not [considered to be] Peret. Two stalks [of grain] separated from one another in the usual fashion are [considered to be] Leket (fallen stalks), [but] three [stalks of grain] are not [considered to be] Leket. These are the words of Bet Hillel. Rebbi Yossi says, “Chananyah, the son of the brother of Rebbi Yehoshua says, ‘Any [type of produce] where the property of the poor person (i.e. some kind of gift to the poor) can come in the middle [of two sets of produce, one standing and one detached, both of which are one Seah in volume], for example grain and vineyard, does not combine [to form two Seahs and therefore both parts are still considered to be Shikcha]. However, any [produce] where the property of the poor person (i.e. some kind of gift to the poor) cannot come in the middle [of two sets of produce, one standing and one detached, both of which are one Seah in volume], for example fruits of a tree, does combine [to form two Seahs and therefore both parts are not considered to be Shikcha].’”", 
            "When did they (i.e. the Rabbis) say [that] standing crops [that have not been forgotten] disqualify a sheaf [that was forgotten next to those standing crops from being considered Shikcha (forgotten sheaves)]? At the time when [the standing crops] were not taken in the middle (i.e. between the time when the sheaf was forgotten and remembered by the farmer), but if [the standing crops] were taken in the middle (i.e. prior to the farmer remembering that he forgot that sheaf) then it does not disqualify [that sheaf from being considered Shikcha, and the farmer cannot go back and take it for himself]. “The standing crops of his (i.e. the farmer’s) friend [that were not forgotten] disqualify his (i.e. the farmer’s) [own standing crops that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha], [the standing crops] of wheat [that were not forgotten disqualify the standing crops] of barley [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha], [the standing crops] of a non-Jew [that were not forgotten disqualify the standing crops] of a Jew [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha].” These are the words of Rebbi Meir. But the Chachamim (Sages) say, “[Standing crops that were not forgotten] do not disqualify [other standing crops that were forgotten], unless they were his (i.e. the farmer’s and not someone else’s) [own] and [they were] of the same kind [of crops].” Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says, “Just like standing crops [that were not forgotten] disqualify a sheaf [that was forgotten from being considered Shikcha], so too the sheaf [that was not forgotten] disqualifies standing crops [that were forgotten from being considered Shikcha]. And [the reason for this law] is a Kal Vechomer (derivation from minor to major) [which goes as follows]. Since standing crops by which the power of the poor person is weak [have the capability to] disqualify a sheaf [from being considered Shikcha], then for sure a sheaf by which the power of the poor person is strong should [have the capability to] disqualify standing crops.” They (i.e. the Chachamim) said [back] to him (i.e. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel), “Rebbi! [That is not correct, because the reverse argument can be made as well, as follows.] Just like standing crops can disqualify a sheaf by which the power of the poor person is strong [from being considered Shikcha], so too the sheaf should disqualify the standing crops by which the power of the poor person is [also] strong [for a different reason as explained in the next Tosefta] [from being considered Shikcha].”", 
            "The power of the poor person is stronger with regards to standing crops than with regards to a sheaf. And [yet at the same time the power of the poor person] is stronger with regards to a sheaf than with regards to standing crops. Because [all three gifts to the poor:] Leket (fallen stalks), Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) and Peah (corners of the field) apply to standing crops, but it is not so with regards to a sheaf, [to which only Shikcha and Peah apply, but Leket does not.] And [yet the opposite is true as well since] the sheaf that is two Seahs [in size by volume] and has been forgotten, is not considered to be Shikcha, unless it is smaller than two Seahs, [whereas standing crops are not considered Shikcha even if they are smaller than two Seahs in size, as long as they have the potential of being two Seahs in size in a different year due to better growth.]", 
            "[A person] who is cutting gavels [of grain, with intention] to bundle them into sheaves later [and not right away], and also [a person who is piling up] heaps of garlic [with intention to make from the heaps] bundles of garlic, or [spread out] onions, [later and not right away, if any of these gavels of grain or heaps of garlic, or spread out onions, have been forgotten in the field, the law of] Shikcha (forgotten sheaves) does not apply to them, [and therefore they still belong to the owner, who can go back and retrieve them.] [A person] who is binding sheaves, because of [an approaching] fire or because of an irrigation canal [that broke through and is about to flood the field, if any of these sheaves have been forgotten in the field the law of] Shikcha does not apply to them, [and therefore they still belong to the owner, who can go back and retrieve them,] because he (i.e. the farmer) will check [the field for any forgotten sheaves, since he is not harvesting them, but rather moving them out of the way of the fire or flooding water.] It happened with a certain pious person that he forgot a sheaf in his field [during harvest,] and he said to his son, “Go [to the Temple in Jerusalem] and sacrifice in my name a bull for Korban Olah (burnt-offering) and a bull for Korban Shlamim (peace-offering).” He (i.e. his son) said [back] to him (i.e. the father), “Father! What have you seen in this commandment [of Shikcha that caused you] to rejoice [about it] more than all [other] commandments that are mentioned in the Torah?” He (i.e. the father) said [back] to him (i.e. the son), “All [other] commandments [that are mentioned] in the Torah have been given to us by God [to be executed] consciously (i.e. on purpose with intent). [But] this [commandment of Shikcha was given to us by God to be executed] unconsciously (i.e. accidentally due to forgetfulness), because if we would have done it willingly (i.e. left the sheaf in the field on purpose for the poor to take) in front of God, this commandment would not be counted for us [as a fulfilled commandment of Shikcha, but rather as a random act of kindness.]” He (i.e. the son) said [back] to him (i.e. the father), “It says [in the Torah], ‘When you will harvest your harvest in your field and you will forget a sheaf in the field, do not go back to take it. It shall be [left there] for the Non-Jewish resident, for the orphan, and for the widow, in order that Hashem, your God, will bless you with all the deeds of your hand.’ (Devarim 24:19) The verse has granted him (i.e. the farmer who left the sheaf in the field) a blessing. [But why did the verse need to say explicitly that the farmer will get a blessing?] Is not it a Kal Vechomer (derivation from minor to major) [which can be concluded by us logically without the need of an explicit verse]? Just like someone who did not intend to do something good, but he [ended up] doing something good [anyway], the verse considers him as if he has done something good, so for sure someone who intended to do something good, and [ended up] doing something good [that he meant to do] how much more so [should get a blessing]?” Similarly, [it says in the Torah:] “If a soul from the common people sins by accident by doing one of the negative commandments of Hashem, and becomes guilty of it. When his sin which he sinned will become known to him … (the verses go on to describe the sacrifice that the sinner should bring) … and the priest will atone for him, and he will be forgiven.” (Vayikra 4:27-31) And it is a Kal Vechomer [which can be concluded by us logically]! Just like someone who did not intend to sin, but sinned [anyway], we consider him as if he sinned. So someone who intended to sin and [then] sinned, how much more so [should be considered as if he sinned. And therefore will for sure get punished.]"
