            "Vayikra Rabbah 25:3: Rabbi Yehudah ben Shimon began his discourse with the text, “After the Lord your G-d shall you walk” (Deuteronomy 12:5). But can a man of flesh and blood walk after the Holy One, blessed be He(?)… But in truth the Holy One, blessed be He, from the very beginning of the creation of the world, was before all else occupied with plantation, as is proved by the text, “And the Lord G-d planted a garden in the first instance in Eden” (Genesis 2:8), and so do you also, when you enter into the land, occupy yourselves first with nothing else but plantation; hence it is written, “And when you shall come into the land, then you shall plant."
