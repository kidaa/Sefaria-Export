        "You asked of me, my brother and dear friend, to enlighten you about The Exalted and Blessed Holy One's names so that you may fulfill your wants and obtain your cherished desires through them.  And because I’ve seen that your intention is honest and good, I feel obliged to do more and show you the way that gives light that you may know what is the way that pleases The Blessed Name from that which does not. And when you have obtained this knowledge, you will call and God will answer; you’ll be close to Him and love Him with all your soul and you will delighted about Him and He will fulfill your cherished desires. ", 
        "It is known to all that the God of the Universe is YOVA and His Name inspires a trembling in all creatures, in heaven above and on earth below; the earth quakes in dread of Him, and no one can endure His rage nor be shielded against His wrath.  He places no trust even in His holy ones nor do the heavens hold any merit in His eyes; how then, can a man, blemished with misdeeds, have any sway?  And how can a mere mortal presume to use His Holy Names, to make of them a cutting ax [a tool]? Who is so audacious and so arrogant as to fill his heart to do so, to grab the Royal Crown [His Holy Names] for his own use!?Indeed our teachers of blessed memory taught that he who pronounces the Name [Tetragrammaton] letter-by-letter has no portion in the world-to-come.   And indeed, the holy Rabbi Hanina ben Tradion, who did not pronounce The Name in a casual way, neither in a self-serving way – only with great respect and only in order to learn and understand the ways of the Blessed God – was punished nevertheless; and we, who are poor [in knowledge] and deficient [in merit], [deserve to be punished] all the more! Furthermore, you see what the Blessed God wrote in his Torah: “Do not speak The Name of YOVA, your God, in vain”.  And even though the intention is to warn against a false oath, we learn from the verse not to utter His Name in vain; since it [the verse] could have said ‘do not vow by The Name YOVA, your God, falsely” yet it is written “Do not take The Name of YOVA, your God, in vain” — thus, we learn both meanings. And Moses, our teacher, may peace be on him, when he ascended on high and learned from the highest ranking angels the secret of proclaiming aloud the Blessed Name and then alerted Israel about this and said: “When I cry out The Name YOVA, you shall proclaim ‘Greatness to our God!’”. And if the angels on high are cautious about mentioning The Name YOVA, The Blessed Name, how much more so, we, who have no worth, and even more so, he, that persuaded himself to make use of His Maker’s Crown; notwithstanding that in our day there are no adepts in the pronunciation of The Name and how to apply it in practice.                                                                                                                                           If so, then that one who calls on The Name attains nothing but the loss of his world and all his efforts are in vain.  And about this and the like, our teachers of blessed memory taught: “Anyone who shows no concern about His Maker’s honor does not deserve to be born.”"
