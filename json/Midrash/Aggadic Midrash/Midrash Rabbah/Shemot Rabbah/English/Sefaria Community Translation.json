            "And these are the names of the Sons of Israel that came into Egypt with Yaakov, every man came with his household – There it is written (Mishlei 13, 24): “He who spares the rod hates his son; but he who loves him discipline shim in his youth.” Ordinarily in the world, if a person says to his friend:  “So-and-so hit your son”, he would be ready to reduce his livelihood. And why is it taught “ He who spares the rod hates his son”?! In order to teach you, that anyone who refrains from disciplining his son in the end causes him to fall into evil ways and will hate him.  This is what we have found with Yishmael, who behaved wickedly on Avraham his father but did not rebuke him, with the result that he fell into evil ways and he hated him and he left from his house with nothing. What did Yishmael do when he was fifteen years old? He started to bring idols from the market and he would play with them and worship them as he had seen others do, immediately (Bereishit 21, 9) “And Sarah saw the son of  the Egyptian Hagar that she had given birth for Avraham was fooling around etc…”  And there is no fooling except for idol worship, like that it says (Shemot 32,6): And they rose up to fool around. Immediately (Bereishit 21,10): And she said to Avraham , Send out this maid-servant and her son, perhaps my son will learn from him. Immediately, (Bereishit 21,11) And this thing was very bad in the eyes of Avraham etc...on account of his son because he had become evil. (Bereshit 21,12) And G-d said to Avraham, do not let it be evil in your eyes etc... From here you can learn, that Avraham was secondary to Sarah in prophecy, following on, (Bereishit 21,14): And Avraham got up in the morning and he took bread and a bottle of water, to teach you, that he hated Yishmael because of his evil ways, and sent him and his mother Hagar empty-handed and expelled them from his house because of this. Do you really think that Avraham, of whom it is written (Bereishit 13,2): And Avraham was very rich in cattle etc... that he would send his wife and his son from his house empty-handed, without clothes or means of a livelihood?! Rather, this is to teach you, since he turned evil, he stopped thinking about him. What was his end? After he had been expelled, he sat at the cross-roads and was a bandit, as it says (Bereishit 16,12): And he was a wild man. And similar to this (Bereishit 25,28): And Yitzchak loved Esav, therefore he turned to evil ways, because he was not rebuked, like we were taught: Five transgressions the evil Esav transgressed on that day: He seduced an engaged lady, and killed a man, denied resurrection, and rejected the fundamentals of religion and spurned his birthright, that he desired the death of his father, and sought to kill his brother, as it says (Bereishit 27,41):May the days of mourning for my father be brought close etc.. And he forced Ya'acov to flee from his father. And he even went with Yishmael, to learn from his evil ways and to add to his wives, as it says (Bereshit 28,9): And Esav went to Yishmael. Similarly with David, that he did not rebuke or chastise his son Avshalom, he turned to evil ways and sought to kill his father, and he lay with concubines, and becoming the cause if his wandering, bare-footed and crying, and many thousands and myriads of Israelites were slaughtered, and he caused much suffering upon them which did not end. As it is written (Psalms 3,1): A song of David, when he fled from Avshalom his son, just as it was writtenafter (Psalms 3,2) How great in number have my enemies become etc.", 
            "Furthermore: \"And these are the names...\" Rabbi Abahu said: Whenever the text states \"These\" (eileh), it comes to contrast the preceding text. \"And these\" (ve-eileh) connotes addition to the preceding remarks. \"These are the stories of the heavens and earth\", comes to constrast the \"chaos and void\". \"And these are the names\" comes to add praise to the seventy people (in Jacob's household that descended into Egypt) mentioned above, in that all of them were righteous.", 
            "And these are the names of the Children of Israel who came to Egypt, Jacob and his sons, each man and his household came - Israel is comparable to the multitude of the heavens, here it is said names, and it is said of stars names, as it is said (Psalms 147:4): \"He counteth the number of the stars; He giveth them all their names,\" even the Holy One Blessed is He, when Israel descended to Egypt, counted how many they were, and because they are compared to the stars, He gave them all names, as it is written: \"And these are the names of the Children of Israel, etc.\"",

            "\"And Yosef and his brothers and their entire generation passed away\", to teach you that as long as one of them was still alive from the original ones that came down to Egypt, the Egyptians did not enslave the Israelites. \"And the children of Israel reproduced and spawned\", even though Yosef and his brothers died, their God did not die, instead the children of Israel reproduced and spawned. Another point: Each one gave birth to six children in each pregnancy, as it says: \"And the children of Israel reproduced and spawned ...\" Some say: Twelve [children in each pregnancy] as it is written: \"reproduced\" - two, \"spawned\" - two, \"they were many\" - two, \"they were massive\" - two, \"very much\" - two, \"and the land was filled with them\" - two, for a total of twelve. \"They were massive\", some say: six children in each pregnancy. And don't be incredulous, since the scorpion is one of the creatures like a vermin and it gives birth to seventy at a time. \"And the land was filled with them\", like a field of reeds. \"A new king arose\", since the Egyptians saw this, they enacted new decrees upon them.  That which is written: \"A new king arose\", Rav and Shmuel [interpret it].  One says: literally new. And one says: his decrees were new, he established decrees and punishments on them. The reason of the one that says it was literally a new king, as it is written: \"new\". The reason of the one that says it is referring to new decrees, since it is not written: \"and he died\", \"and the king was anointed\", \"that did not know of Yosef\". According to the opinion that it is a new king, everything is clear. According to the opinion that they established new decrees, how does he explain [\"that did not know of Yosef\"]?  That he was like one who did not know of Yosef at all. The Rabbis say: Why was he called a new king, it was the same Pharaoh as before? Instead, the Egyptians said to Pharaoh: \"let us intermarry with this nation\". He said to them: \"You are crazy! Until now we have eaten from their produce, how can we intermarry with them?! Were it not for Yosef we would all be dead.\" Since they didn't listen to him, they deposed him from the throne for three months, until he said to them: \"Whatever you want to do I am with you\", and they re-appointed him, there it is written: \"A new king arose\". The rabbis segue to the following verse (Hoshea 5:7): \"Against God they have rebelled since they have given birth to foreign children, now the month will consume their parts\". To teach you, that when Yosef died they stopped performing circumcision. They said: Let us be like the Egyptians, from this you learn, that Moshe circumcised them when they left Egypt, and since they did this [stopped observing circumcision], God converted the love of the Egyptians for them into hatred, as it says (Tehillim 105:25): \"He converted their harts to hate his nation, to harass his servants\", to fulfill the verse (Hoshea 5:7): \"Now the month [new] will consume their parts\" [translator's note: the word \"month\" has been amended by the Midrash to the word \"new\" which uses the same letters but different vowels for the purposes of the interpretation]. \"A new king\", that stood and enacted new decrees upon them. \"That did not know of Yosef\", and did he really not know of Yosef?! Rabbi Abin said: It is like a parable of one who stoned to death the king's lover. The king orders his men to puncture the head of the person, for tomorrow he will attempt to stone the king as well, therefore the text speaks of him [pharaoh] - in other words: today - \"he did not know of Yosef\", tomorrow  - he will say in the future (Shemot 5:2): \"I do not know of God\".

            "And when the Israelite women conceived, they would return to their homes. When they were about to go into labor, the women would go out into the fields and give birth in the apple orchards, as it is written: \"I woke you under the apple [tree]\" (Song of Songs 8:5). And the Lord Blessed be He would send an angel from the heavens who cleaned them and made them beautiful, just as a new mother grooms her infant, as it is written: \"And as for your birth, on the day you were born...\" (Ezekiel 16:4), and He grants them two round cakes, one of oil and the other of honey, as it is written: \"And He [God] suckled Him [ The Children of Israel] with honey from the rock...\" (Deuteronomy 32:13). And as soon as the Egyptians would become aware of this, they sought to kill them. And a miracle happened, and the cihldren were swallowed up by the earth, and bulls would come and plow the ground above them, as it is written: \"Upon my back the plowers plowed\" (Psalms 129:3). And once the Egyptians would pass, the infants would rise up from the mud like grass from the field, as it is written: \"I have made you grow like the plantlings in the field...\" (Ezekiel 16:7) And when the babes grew, they would flock to their homes in great droves, as it says: \"And you came in all your finest and dressiest,\" (Ezekiel 16:7) - do not read \"finest and dressiest\" but rather \"flocked in droves.\" And when the Lord Blessed be He revealed Himself at the Sea of Reeds, they were the first to recognize Him instantly, as it says: \"THIS is my God, and I will praise Him.\" (Exodus 15:2).

Judah b. Zebina said: \"This means that he acted toward her as if it was their first marriage; he placed her upon the litter, and Miriam and Aaron danced before them, and the ministering angels said (Ps. 113:9): 'The joyful mother of children.'\" \"A daughter of Levi\" - How can this be? She was one hundred thirty years old and he calls her \"a daughter\"?! As R. Hama b. Hanina said: \"She was Jochebed; she was conceived on the way [to Egypt] and born between the walls, as it says (Num. 26:59): 'Who was born to Levi in Egypt' - born in Egypt but not conceived.

            "And his sister stood from afar... - Why did Miriam stand from afar? Rabbi Amram said in the name of Rav: Because Miriam prophesied and said \"In the future, Mother will give birth to a child that will be the savior of the Jewish people.\" When Moshe was born, the entire house was filled with light. [Miriam's] father arose and kissed her on the head. He [Amram] said to her [Miriam]: \"My daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled\". That is what is said (Exodus 15:20) \"And Miriam the Prophetess, the brother of Aharon, took the tambourine...\" Was she only the brother of Aharon and not the brother of Moshe? Rather, she had stated that prophecy while she was the sister of Aharon and not (yet) the sister of Moshe.  When they put him (Moshe) in the river, her mother arose and hit her on the head and said to her daughter: \"My daughter, where is your prophecy!?\" And this is why the verse says \"And his sister stood by from afar\", for she wanted to know what would be the results of her prophecy. And the Rabbis say the entire verse was said with the Divine Spirit. \"And she stood\" similar to (Samuel I 3:10) \"And G-D came and stood\". \"His Sister\" similar to (Proverbs 7:4) \"Say to wisdom, she is your sister\". \"From afar\" similar to (Jeremiah 31:2) \"From afar G-D is seen to me\". \"To know what will happen to him\" similar to (Samuel I 2:3) \"For G-D is all knowing\". <br><br>\"And his sister stood back\" - Why did Miriam stand back? Rabbi Amram said in the name of Rav: \"Because Miriam had prophesied: 'In the future, my mother will give birth to a son who will save Israel'.  When Moses was born, the whole house was filled with light; her father rose and kissed her on the head.  He said to her: 'My daughter! Your prophecy has come to pass' - as it is written [Exodus 15:20]: 'And Miriam the prophetess, sister of Aaron, took up the timbrel.'  [Why was she called] 'Sister of Aaron,' and not 'sister of Moses'?!  Because when she issued her prophecy, she was [only] the sister of Aaron - Moses had not been born yet.  When she cast him into the Nile, her mother rose and struck her on the head. She said: 'My daughter! What has become of your prophecy?!'  This is why it is written 'his sister stood back etc.': in order to know would become of her prophecy.  And our rabbis taught: This entire verse speaks [not of Miriam, but] of the Holy Spirit.  'And she stood...' refers to 'The LORD came and stood...' [I Samuel 3:10]; '[His] sister' refers to 'Say to Wisdom: \"You are my sister\"' [Proberbs 7:4].  'Back' refers to 'The Lord appeared to me from far back' [Jeremiah 31:3].  'In order to know what would happen to him' refers to 'For the LORD is a God of knowledge.' [I Samuel 2:3]\".",

            "\"And the child (Moses) grew\" - Twenty four months she nursed him, and you say \"and the child grew\"?! Rather he grew, not in the way of the [rest] land. “And she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh…” The daughter of Pharaoh would kiss and hug and adore him (Moses) as if he were her own son, and she would not take him out of the king’s palace. And because [Moses] was so beautiful, everyone yearned to see him. One that would see him would not leave his presence. And it was that Pharaoh would kiss him (Moses) and hug him, and he would remove Pharaoh’s crown and place it on his own head, as he would do to him in the future when he was great. And just as the Holy One Blessed is He said to Hiram (Ezekiel 28:18), “…I have brought fire from within you, it will consume you…”, similarly the daughter of Pharaoh raised the one who would punish her father in the future. And even the anointed king, that is destined to punish Edom, sits among them in their [own] province, as it says (Isaiah 27:10) “…there shall the calf (the Messiah) graze and there lie down and destroy its branches.” And some of the observers sitting among them were the magicians of Egypt that said, “We are wary of this, that he is taking your crown and placing it on his head, that he not be the one we say (i.e. prophesy) that will take the kingship from you.” Some said to kill him, and some said to burn him. And Jethro was sitting among them and said to them, “This child has no intent [to take the throne]. Rather, test him by bringing in a bowl [a piece of] gold and a coal. If he outstretches his hand towards the gold, [surely] he has intent [to take the throne], and you should kill him. And if he outstretches his hand towards the coal, he [surely] does not have intent [to take the throne], and he does not deserve the death penalty.” They immediately brought the bowl before him (Moses), and he outstretched his hand to take the gold, and Gabriel came and pushed his (Moses’) hand, and he grabbed the coal. He then brought his hand along with the coal into his mouth and burned his tongue, and from this was made (Exodus 4:10) “slow of speech and slow of tongue.” “And she called his name ‘Moshe’” – From here you can learn about the merit of those that perform acts of kindness. Even though Moses had many names, the only name that was set throughout the Torah, was the name that Bathyah daughter of Pharaoh called him. Even the Holy One Blessed is He did not call him by another name.   ", 
            "And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up (Exodus 2:11).  Moses was 20 years old at the time, and some say 40 years old.<br>  \"When Moses was grown up\" - and does not everyone grow up?  Rather, this tells you that he grew up [in a manner] unlike the whole world.<br>\"He went out unto his brethren.\"  This righteous man went out twice, and the Holy One Blessed is He wrote them one after another.  \"And he went out the second day\" (Exodus 2:13)--this is two.<br>\"And [he] looked on their burdens.\"  What is, \"And [he] looked?\"  For he would look upon their burdens and cry and say, \"Woe is me unto you, who will provide my death instead of yours, for there is not more difficult labor than the labor of the mortar.\"  And he would give of his shoulders [i.e. use his shoulders to] assist each one of them.  Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Yose the Galilean said: [If] he saw a large burden on a small person and a small burden on a large person, or a man's burden on a woman and a woman's burden on a man, or an elderly man's burden on a young man and a young man's burden on an elderly man, he would leave aside his rank and go and right their burdens, and act as though he were assisting Pharaoh.  The Holy One Blessed is He said: You left aside your business and went to see the sorrow of Israel, and acted toward them as brothers act.  I will leave aside the upper and the lower [i.e. ignore the distinction between Heaven and Earth] and talk to you.  Such is it written, \" And when the LORD saw that [Moses] turned aside to see\" (Exodus 3:4).  The Holy One Blessed is He saw Moses, who left aside his business to see their burdens.  Therefore, \"God called unto him out of the midst of the bush\" (ibid.).", 
            "Another interpretation: \"And he saw their suffering\" that they did not have rest. He went and said to Pharaoh, \" One who has a slave, if he does not rest one day a week, he will die! While your slaves, if you don't allow them rest one day a week , they will die!\" He said to them, \"Go and do for them as you are saying.\" Moses went and established the Sabbath day for them to rest.

They said to him: you are not yet worthy of being a ruler and a judge over as, for [it is said, Avot 5:21] \"at forty [one aquires] wisdom.\" R. Nehemia said: He [Moshe] was of forty years at that time. They said to him: surely you are a man [of age], only you are not worthy to be a ruler and a judge over us. The sages say: They said to him: are you indeed the son of Yocheved? Then why do they call you son of Batya?! and you presume to be a ruler and a judge over us?! We will let be known what you did to the Egyptian. \"Do you mean [Lit. say] to kill me?’ It is not written \"do you mean\", but \"do you say\". From this you learn, that [Moshe] uttered the proper name [of G-d] unto the Egyptian and killed him. When he [Moshe] heard this, his became fearful of Lashon Ha'ra [the evil toung]. And he [Moshe] said \"surely the thing is known\". R. Yehudah son of R. Shalom said in the name of Hanina the Great and our sages who [in turn] said in the name of R. Alexandri: Moshe would wonder to himself and say: \"what was Israel's sin, for which they became more enslaved than all other nation?\" When he heard his [the Hebrew who struck his fellow's] words, he [Moshe] said: \"such Lashon Harah [evil toung] is amongst them, how would they be worthy of redemption?\".

As Moses approached the lamb, he said, “I did not know you ran away because you were thirsty. You are so exhausted!” He then put the lamb on his shoulders and carried him back.

            "5. \"An angel of the LORD appeared to him.\" It is written: \"I sleep, but my heart is awake\" (Song of Songs 5:2). I am sleeping [from performing] the commandments, but my heart is awake to perform  them. \"My undefiled [tamati]\" (ibid.) at Sinai, for they attached themselves [nitmemu] to Me at Sinai and said: \"Everything the LORD had spoken we will do and obey\" (Exodus 24:7). R. Yannai said: Just as twins [te'omim] feel one another's s headaches, [so too] God said, as it were [as if He were our twin]: \"I am with him in sorrow\" (Psalms 91:15). Another explanation: What is [the meaning of] \"I am with him in sorrow\"? When they have sorrows they only call out to the Holy One, Blessed be He. In Egypt, [as it is written] \"And their cry came up unto God\" (Exodus 2:23). By the sea [as it is written] \"And the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord\" (ibid. 14:10) and there are many other  examples like these. And it says: \"In all their sorrows He [too] was in sorrow\" (Isaiah 63:9). The Holy One, Blessed be He said to Moses, You do not sense that I too dwell in sorrow just as Israel dwells in sorrow. But you should know: from the place I speak to you from within the thorn-bush, [that is a sign] as it were that I too am a partner in their sorrow. \"An angel of the LORD appeared.\" R. Yohanan said: This is Michael. R. Hanina said, it was Gabriel. Whenever they saw R. Yose the tall, they used to say, There is our holy Rabbi! So too wherever Michael appears, he is the Glory of the Shechinah. \"To him.\" What does \"to him\" [imply]? To teach that other men were with him, yet only Moses saw [the angel]. So too it is written regarding Daniel: \"And only I Daniel saw the vision.\" (Daniel 10:7). \"In a flame of fire...\" to embolden him, so that when he would come to Sinai and saw the fires he should not be afraid of them. Another explanation of \"In a flame [labat] of fire\" - from the upper half of the bush, jut as the heart ([leb] is in the upper half of a man. \"From within the bush.\" A Gentile once asked R. Joshua b. Karhah: Why did the Holy One, Blessed be He, see fit to speak to Moses from within a thorn-bush? [R. Joshua retorted]: If it had been a carob tree or a sycamore tree, would you not have asked the same question. However to send you away you without any answer is not possible, [so] why from within a thorn-bush? To teach you that there is no empty place devoid of the Shechinah, not even a [lowly] thorn-bush. \"In a flame of fire.\" At first only one angel descended and stood in the center of the fire as an intermediary. Only afterwards did the Shechinah descend and spoke with him from within the thorn-bush. Rabbi Eliezer said: Just as the thorn-bush is the lowliest of all trees in the world, so too Israel were lowly and downtrodden in Egypt. Therefore the Holy One, Blessed be He revealed Himself to them and redeemed them, as it says (Exodus 3:8) \"And I will go down and save them from the Egypt.\" Rabbi Yossi said: Just as the thorn-bush is the hardest of all the trees, and any bird that enters into it does not come out unharmed, so too the servitude in Egypt was harsher to God more than any other servitude in the world, as it says (Ibid. 7) \"And the LORD said seen I have seen the poverty of My people.\" Why does the verse say \"see I have seen\" twice? For after they drowned them in the river they would then bury them in a building. This can be compared to someone who took a staff and hit two people, and the two of them received [a lashing] with a whip and know its suffering. So too the suffering and the servitude of Israel was revealed and known to the One who spoke and thereby was the world, as it says \"For I know their pains.\" Rabbi Yohanan said: Just as this thorn-bush is used as a fence for a garden, so too Israel is a fence for the world. Alternatively, just as the thorn-bush grows near any water, so too Israel only grows in the merit of Torah which is called water, as it says (Isaiah 55:1) \"Ho any thirsty one go to water.\" Alternatively, just as the thorn-bush grows in a garden or in a river, so too Israel are in this world and the next world. Alternatively, just as the thorn-bush produces thorns and roses, so too Israel contains righteous and wicked people. Rabbi Pinhas ha-Kohen the son of Rabbi Hama said: Just as this thorn-bush, if someone puts his hand in he does not feel anything, but when he takes it out it gets scratched; so too when Israel went down to Egypt no one noticed anything, but when they went out \"The Lord plagued Pharoah\" (Genesis 12:17). Alternatively, \"From with in the thorn-bush.\" Rabbi Nahman the son of Rabbi Shmuel the son of Nahman said: of all the trees, some produce one leaf, some two or three. A myrtle produces three, as it says (Leviticus 23:40) \"A plaited tree\". A thorn-bush however has five leafs.  The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses, Israel will only be redeemed in the merit of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and in your and Aaron's merit. Alternatively, \"From with in the thorn-bush.\" He hinted to him [Moses] that he would live 120 years, the numerical value of the thorn-bush [הסנה - ה=5 ס=60, נ=50, ה=5]. \"And he saw and behold the thorn-bush was consumed by fire.\" From here they said, Heavenly fire raises palm branches and burns but does not consume and is black. Earthly fire does not raise palm branches and is red, consumes and does not burn. And why did the Holy One, Blessed be He reveal Himself to Moses in this way? Because he [Moses] thought in his heart, saying, Maybe the Egyptians will destroy Israel. Therefore the Holy One, Blessed be He revealed Himself in a thorn-bush that was burning but not consumed. He said to him, just as the thorn-bush is burning but is not consumed, so too the Egyptians will not be able to destroy Israel. Alternatively, since the Holy One, Blessed be He was talking with Moses and he did not want stop his task [of minding the sheep], He showed him this thing so he would turn his face and see Him. You find this [intimated] from the beginning [of the verse]: \"An angel of the LORD appeared to him\" - yet Moses did not go. Once he stopped doing his task and went to see, immediately  \"God called him\" (Exodus 3:4)."

Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said to him: Let the mouths of the heretics be stopped up. Rather, (Mishlei 3:34) If it concerns the scorners, he scorns them. When the Holy One Blessed be He warns a man once, twice, thrice and he doesn't repent, and G-d will close his heart against repentance so that He should not exact vengeance from him for his sins. So to with the wicked Pharaoh, since Hashem sent five times to him and he took no notice, G-d then said: \"You have stiffened your neck and hardened your heart; well, I will add impurity to your impurity\". Hence, \"For I have hardened his heart\". What does \"I have hardened\" imply? That G-d made his heart like a liver (כבד) into which even if boiled a second time no juice enters; so also was the heart of Pharaoh made like a liver, and he did not receive the words of G-d. Hence, \"For I have hardened his heart\". "

            "\"And it was in the middle of the night\" (Exodus 12:29) - this is [the meaning of] what is written (Isaiah 44:26), \"He fulfills the word of His servant and completes the counsel of His messengers:\" Rabbi Abahu said, \"'He fulfills the word of His servant' - this [refers to] Moshe as it is stated (Numbers 12:7), 'Not so My servant Moshe.'\" And how is it that He fulfilled it? Rather, when He brought the plague of darkness upon them, Pharaoh began to cry out (Exodus 10:24), \"Go and serve the Lord, but your sheep and cattle must stay.\" Moshe said to him, \"Upon your life! 'And also our livestock we will take, not one hoof will remain' (Ibid. 26).\" What is [meant by] a hoof? Even an animal that belongs completely to an Egyptian and has one hoof that belongs to a Jew, [Moshe] will not leave. \"Since from them shall we take\" (Ibid.) - after he said, \"from them shall we take,\" he went back and said \"and we do not know with what we will serve the Lord.\" He said to him, \"If with you, who are flesh and blood, [and] people die if they transgress your commands; [nonetheless] if you put out a proclamation in front of you and you say, collect this and that for me, the world can stand in front of you [and fulfill your proclamation]; but with us, perhaps God will say to us, 'sacrifice a sacrifice [that includes all of the sacrifices] of two hundred and ten years.'\" That is [what is meant by] \"and we do not know.\" Pharaoh said to him, \"Until when will you enter here? 'Go away from me; guard yourself, do not see my face again!' (Ibid. 28)\" Moshe said [back] to him, \"you have spoken well; 'I will not see your face again.'\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"What is still required for me? To inform Pharaoh of one plague.\" Immediately, He went into the palace of Pharaoh for Moshe - who said to [Pharaoh], \"I will not see your face again\" - so that he would not be found to be a fabricator. And you find that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not speak with Moshe in the house of Pharaoh except for that time. From where [do we know this]? As it is stated (Exodus 9:29), \"When  I leave the city, I will raise my hands to the Lord;\" and now the Holy One, blessed be He, hastened and spoke with Moshe, as it is stated (Exodus 11:1), \"still one plague will I bring upon Pharaoh, etc.\" Once Moshe heard [this], he rejoiced and became great, as it is stated, (Ibid. 3) \"and also the man, Moshe, was very great.\" He begin to cry out in public (Ibid. 4), \"'so did the Lord say, \"at the middle of the night.\"' You have spoken well, 'I will not see your face again.' I, myself, will not come again to you, but rather you will come to me; and your general that is standing with you - and he is your head officer - and all of these [in] your palace retinue will come to me with you and request of me - and bow down to me - that we should leave from here;\" as it is written (Ibid. 8), \"And all of your servants will come down to me and bow down to me saying\" - he did not want to say, 'and you will bow down to me' because of the honor of the king. When the middle of the night arrived, as Moshe said; immediately, \"And it was the middle of the night and the Lord smote every firstborn.\" Hence, \"He fulfills the word of his servant. And completes the counsel of His messengers\" - that He made a counsel (agreement) with Avraham because of this thing. When? When the kings came and he pursued them. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"It is enough for you until the middle of the night - come, let us split the night, you and I;\" as it is stated, \"And he divided against them at night (understood here as 'and He divided the night for them').\" When the time came, he completed his counsel. That is [the meaning of] \"And it was in the middle of the night.\" Thus is it written,  \"And completes the counsel of His messengers.\" ", 
            "Another explanation: \"And it was in the middle of the night\" - this is [the meaning of] that which is written (Psalms 119, 62), \"At midnight I arise to praise You for the judgments of your charity (<i>mishpetei tzidkecha</i>):\" \"At midnight I arise to praise You for\" the judgments You enacted upon the Egyptians, and [that] for us You enacted charity. How is this? Rather, once Moshe said (Exodus 12:12), \"and I will smite every firstborn,\" some of them began to fear, and there were [also] from them who were not afraid. One who was afraid would take his firstborn to a Jew and say to him, \"I request of you, take this one and he will lodge with you.\" When the middle of the night arrived, the Holy One, blessed be He, killed all of the firstborn. And [concerning] those that were placed in the houses of the Jews, the Holy One, blessed be He, would skip between the Jews and the Egyptians and take the soul of the Egyptian and leave the soul of the Jew. And the Jew would wake up and find the Egyptian dead between all [of the Jews around him], as it is stated (Ibid. 13), \"and I will skip over you and there will not be a plague among you.\" The Jews [then] began to say, \"At midnight I arise to praise You.\" Thus is it written (Psalms 119, 160), \"all of the judgments of your charity.\"", 
            "Another explanation: \"And it was in the middle of the night\" - this is [the meaning of] that which is written (Proverbs 31:18), \"She has understanding as her merchandise is good, her candle does not, etc.\" You find that the verse stated (Exodus 12:30), \"as there was not a house that did not have a dead person there.\" How? If you count each and every drop that an Egyptian put out to each and every woman [that had not yet given birth] or the first drop [to women that had already given birth from other men], it will be found that all of the boys were dying, as it is stated (Psalms 88:51), \"And he smote every firstborn in Egypt, the beginning of their strength in the tents of Cham.\" The first drop [that were] female firstborns also died, except for Batya the daughter of Pharaoh who had a good (<i>tov</i>) defender; that was Moshe, as it is stated (Exodus 2:2), \"and she saw that he was goodly (<i>tov</i>).\" Hence Shlomo said \"She has understanding as her merchandise is good.\" \"And she gets up while it is still night\" (Proverbs 31:15) - in what night? \"And it was in the middle of the night.\"", 
            "Another explanation:  \"And it was in the middle of the night\" - Elihu said (Job 34:20), \"In one moment they die and at midnight:\" When they died, everyone began to cry out, as it is stated (Exodus 12:30), \"And Pharaoh got up at night, he and all of his servants and all of Egypt.\" Immediately (Ibid. 31), \"And he called to Moshe and Aharon.\" Moshe said to him, \"What does Pharaoh request? Who is coming to who, you to me or me to you?\" He said [back] to him, \"I request from you (Ibid.), 'Get up and go out from among my people.'\" Why? \"He is wise-hearted and courageous in strength; who has hardened his heart against Him and come out whole?\" (Job 9:4) ", 
            "Another explanation:  \"And it was in the middle of the night\" - David said (Psalms 77:7), \"I recall my music at night:\" The congregation of Israel said, \"I recall the breakings, that You broke the enemies for my sake at night.\" And [the term], 'my music' (<i>niginati</i>) only means breaking, as you would say (Lamentations 3:63), \"I am their song.\" And I [would also] say (Genesis 14:20), \"who gave over (<i>migen</i>) your enemies into your hand.\" Sancheriv came against us - You broke him at night, as it is stated (II Kings 19:35), \"And it was on that night and the angel of the Lord came out and he smote in the camp of Assyria.\" Rabbi Nechemia said, \"Come and see the love of the Holy One, blessed be He for Israel; as behold, the ministering angels - who are mighty of strength, doers of His will - the Holy One, blessed be He, made them guardians over Israel. And who are they? Michael and Gavriel, as it is stated (Isaiah 62:6), 'Upon your walls Jerusalem, I have appointed guardians.' And when Sancheriv came, Michael went out and smote them; and Gavriel, from the command of the Holy One, blessed be He, saved Chanania and his friends.\" Why was it like that? Rather the Holy One, blessed be He, made a condition with them. When? When He wanted to go down to save Avaraham from the fiery pit: Michael and Gavriel said in front of Him, \"We will go down to save him.\" He said [back] to them, \"If [even] one of you would go down there to the pit, you would save him, but [since Avraham] went down for My name, then I will go down and save him,\" as it is stated (Genesis 15:7), \"I am the Lord who took you out of the Ur Kasdim (understood here as the fire of Kasdim);\" \"but I will give you a time [to go down and save others.\"] When did they go down? \"Since you were prepared to save him for My honor, you, Michael [will descend] against the camp of Assyria; and you, Gavriel [will descend]  against the camp of Kasdim (the Chaldeans).\" When Gavriel went down to save Chanania, Mishael and Azaria, he tore the fire and came out and set aflame all those that had thrown them in, as it is stated (Daniel 3:22), \"those men that raised Shadrakh, Meshakh, etc.\" And some say, \"Four nations died there: At first, it is written (Ibid. 3), 'Then were gathered the satraps, the prefects, the governors[, etc.]' and the advisers of the king and, here, four [of them] are lacking, as it states (Ibid. 27), 'And the satraps gathered.'\" Hence Chanania said (Psalms 117:1), \"Praise the Lord, all nations;\" Mishael said (Ibid.), \"exalt him all peoples;\" and Azaria said (Ibid. 2), \"Since His kindness has overwhelmed us;\" and the angel said (Ibid.), \"'and the truth of the Lord is forever' - what He said to me when I went down to save Avraham is true.\" And so [too with] Michael, [God] did what He told him, as it is stated (II Kings 19:35), \"And it was on that night and the angel of the Lord came out.\" It was taught, \"All of the commanders and the dukes were drinking wine and left their receptacles thrown out. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Sancheriv, 'You have done yours,' as it is stated (Ibid. 23), 'By the hand of your messengers have you cursed;' 'I too [will act] by the hand of my messenger.'\" What did He do to him? \"And under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.\" (Isaiah 10:16) What is [meant by] \"and under his glory?\" That He burned his body from the inside and left his clothing on the outside, since the glory of a person is his clothing. And why did He leave his clothing? Rather, since they were the descendants of Shem, as it is stated (Genesis 10:22), \"The sons of Shem were Eilam and Ashur (Assyria).\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"I am indebted to Shem, their father, as he and Yafet took their clothing and covered the nakedness of their father,\" as it is stated (Genesis 9:23), \"And Shem and Yafet took the cloak.\" Hence, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Michael, \"Leave their clothing and burn their souls.\" What is written there? \"And they arose in the morning and, behold, dead corpses.\" This is [the meaning of] that which is written (Psalms 101:8), \"In the mornings, I will annihilate the evildoers of the world.\" And Hizkiyahu and Israel were sitting and saying Hallel (Psalms of praise recited on festivals), as it was the night of Pesach, and they were afraid to say [it] now - Jerusalem was being conquered by his hand. When they woke up early in the morning to stand and read the Shema and to pray, they found their enemies were dead corpses. Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Yeshaya (Isaiah 8:3), \"'and call his name, \"quick take booty, fast loot\"' and be quick to loot booty; and the [other] one call 'with us is the Power (<i>Imanuel</i>),' to say that I am with him,\" as it is stated (II Chronicles 32:8), \"with him is the forearm of flesh but with us is the Lord, our God.\"  And just like the Holy One, blessed be He, acted in this world by the hand of Michael and Gavriel, so [too] in the future to come, he will act through them, as it is stated (Obadiah 1:21), \"And the saviors will come up on Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esav\" - this is [referring to] Michael and Gavriel. And our Holy Rabbi said, \"This is Michael by himself, as it is stated (Daniel 12:1), 'And at that time, Michael will stand, the great minister who stands for the children of Your people.'\" As he [is the one that] demands the needs of Israel and speaks for them, as it is stated (Zechariah 1:12), \"And the angel of the Lord answered and said, 'Lord of hosts, until when when will you not have mercy on Jerusalem?'\" And I will [also] say (Daniel 10:21), \"and none is being strong with Me except for Michael, your minister.\" Rabbi Yose said, \"To what are Michael and Samael similar? To a defender and a prosecutor standing in court. This one is speaking and that one is speaking. [When] this one finished his words and that one his words, that defender knows that he has won. [Then] he begins to praise the judge, that issues the verdict. That prosecutor [then] requests to add something. The defender [then] says to him, 'Be quiet and let us hear from the judge.' So is it  that Michael and Samael stand in front of the Divine Presence; and the Satan [Samael] prosecutes and Michael deliberates on the merit of Israel, and [then] the Satan comes to speak and Michael silences him. Why? As it is stated (Psalms 85:9), 'I will hear what the Power, the Lord, will speak, as He will speak peace about His people.'\" This is [the meaning of] \"I recall my music at night\" - about the miracle of Hizkiyahu.  Another explanation: \"I recall my music at night\" - I recall what you have done for us in Egypt, and the plots (<i>menagnin</i>) that you did to the Egyptians. How is it? At first, when the Holy One, blessed be He, requested to bring plagues upon the Egyptians, He said to bring the plague of the firstborn first, as it is stated (Exodus 4:23), \"behold I am killing your son, your firstborn.\" [Pharaoh] started to say (Exodus 5:2), \"Who is the Lord that I should listen to His voice?\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said [to Himself], \"If I bring the plague of the firstborn first, he will send them [right away], but rather I will bring other plagues upon him (first). And in its heels (<i>beekev zot</i>), I will bring them all,\" as it is stated, \"And the Lord smote every firstborn.\" Hence David praises (Psalms 90:11), \"Who knows the boldness of Your anger\" - who knows your plots that You do in the sea, as it is stated (Psalms 77:20), \"In the sea is Your way and Your path in the great waters, and Your footsteps (<i>eekvotekha</i>) were not known\" - things that you do afterward (<i>beekev</i>), who [can] know?   ", 
            "God said to Moshe, \"Say to them, to the Jews, 'What are you doing? Be aware that He will strike the Egyptians,'\" as is is stated (Exodus 12:23), \"And the Lord will pass to strike the Egyptians.\" Rabbi Levi said, \"What is [the meaning of], 'and the Lord will pass (<i>veavar</i>)?' The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, 'I am going against (<i>ohver</i>) that which I said.' There is a parable of a king whose son went to Barbaria. The Barbarians got up and received him and made him king over them. The king heard and said, 'what honor should I do for these [people], who raised my son and crowned him over them? Rather, I shall call the name of that country according to the name of my son.' After some time, they went back and they cursed the son of the king and they subjugated him. The king said, 'I will go against that which I honored them - I will go out and make war with them and rescue my son.' So [too is it that when] Yosef went to Egypt, they received him and made him king over them, as it is stated (Genesis 42:6), 'And Yosef was the ruler over the land;' they honored Yakov, as it is stated (Genesis 50:3), 'and the Egyptians cried for him seventy days.'  The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'What honor should I do for Egypt?  Behold, I will call it with the name of the Garden of Eden,' as it is stated (Genesis 13:10), 'like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt.' When they went back and subjugated them, the Holy One, blessed be He, said (Exodus 12:12), '\"And I will pass over (<i> avarti</i>, here understood as, went against)\" - I am going back from that honor and I will make it into a desolate place,' as it is stated (Joel 4:11), 'Egypt will be a desolate place.'\"", 
            "What is written above? \"And the Lord will pass over the opening.\" (Exodus 12:23) At that time - as if it were possible - He, Himself, stood at the opening. But rather, as it is the custom of the world - in the same way as when a butcher brings in his sheep and he takes red dye and marks each lamb and sheep that he wants to slaughter, in order to recognize which one to slaughter and which one not to slaughter; so too (Ibid.), \"and he will see the blood\" - as if it were possible -  He stood at the entrance and pushed away the destroyer that he should not strike Israel. God said to them (Ibid. 24), \"'And you shall keep this thing as a statute for you and your children forever\" - in the same way as I did [this] for you today, so [too] will I do [it] for you in the future to come,\" as it is stated (Malachi 3:19), \"As behold the day is coming, burning like a furnace, etc.\" \"But [with] you, 'I will have pity upon you as a father has pity on his son.' (Ibid. 17)\"    ", 
            "Rabbi Chalafta said, \"Blessed is the name of the Holy One, blessed be He; as there is nothing like His miracles and His wonders and there is nothing like His heroic deeds and His actions, as it is stated (Psalms 147:5), 'Great is our master and of abundant power.' The Holy One, blessed be He, is holy and pure and extended His arms against the impure. Why? Because He is great and awesome. And for the sake of Israel, He let His power be known. And why for the sake of Israel? Since He said to Yakov (Genesis 46:4), 'And I will go down with you to Egypt,' and He [fights] the wars of Israel: [Only] one angel overturned Sodom, but here (Isaiah 42:13), 'The Lord will go out like a warrior; like a man of war, He will arouse His jealousy.'\" ", 
            "Another explanation:  \"And it was in the middle of the night\" - there is a parable of a king, the country of which overturned the subjugation of prisoners that came to them [by making it unbearable]; so [too] did he overturn the law against them and kill them. Likewise, the Egyptians overturned the decree against the Jews, that they should [work] by day and by night and that they gave the work of a man to a woman and the work of a woman to a man; so [too], God overturned the law against them and killed them at night, as it is stated, \"And it was in the middle of the night.\" Just like He overturned Sodom at night, so [too] did He kill the firstborn of Egypt at night. For this reason did David state (Psalms 76:8), \"You are Fearsome, You; and who can stand before You from when You become angry.\" ", 
            "Many miracles did the Holy One, blessed be He, do for Israel: He killed the firstborn of Egypt - that were compared to animals, as it is stated (Ezekiel 23: 20), \"that their flesh is the flesh of donkeys;\" He killed the firstborn of the captives; since they said to the captive that was imprisoned in the jail, \"Do you want to go out and the Jews will [also] be delivered?\" And he would say, \"We will not ever leave from here in order that Israel not go out.\" That is why He judged them with [the Egyptians] - \"from the firstborn of Pharaoh... to the firstborn of the captive.\" (Exodus 12:29) There is a parable about a king who made a joyous occasion for his son and killed his enemies. The king said, \"Anyone who caused me joy should come to my son's joyous occasion, and anyone who is hated by me will be killed with the enemies.\" So [too], God made a joyous occasion for Israel, since He redeemed them - God said, \"Anyone who loves My son should come and rejoice with My son.\" The proper ones of Egypt came and made a Pesach sacrifice with the Jews and went out with them, as it is stated (Exodus 12:38), \"And also a mixed multitude went out with them.\" And all those that wanted Israel not to be redeemed died with the firstborn, as it is stated (Pslams 78:51), \"And He smote all the firstborn of Egypt.\" They all cried out, as it is stated (Exodus 12:39), \"and there was a great outcry in Egypt.\" They all came to kill Pharaoh. At that time, \"And the Egyptians pressed upon the people (here read, as about the people).\" (Exodus 12:33) And [the Jews at that time] were reciting Hallel; and Pharaoh announced to his warriors, \"Come, let us call to Moshe and Aharon.\" God said to him, \"You are releasing my children at night? You will not release my children at night, but rather they will go out [in plain sight,] in the middle of the day.\" The Jews dispersed into all of Egypt at that time, as it is stated (Ibid. 35), \"And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moshe and borrowed from Egypt.\" And Moshe was busy with the bones of Yosef and the vessels of the Tabernacle that were prepared by Yakov, our father. And hence David said (Pslams 58:11), \"The righteous one will rejoice, since he saw vengeance.\" ", 
            "\"And the children of Israel traveled from Raamses\" (Exodus 12:37) - Rabbi Shmuel says, \"Once they left, they [immediately] baked the dough that they had kneaded, as it is stated (Ibid. 39), 'and they baked dough.'\" \"And it was at the end of four hundred and thirty years, etc\" (Ibid. 41) - from the time that the decree was decreed; as they only spent two hundred and ten years in Egypt. And on the day that they went down to Egypt, on that same day did they go out. And on that day Yosef went out from jail. Hence this night is a joyful occasion for all of Israel, as it is written (Ibid. 42), \"It is a night of watchings for the Lord.\" In this world, he made a miracle for them at night, since it was a temporary miracle, but in the future to come, this night will become a day, as it is stated (Isaiah 30:26), \"And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun and the light of the sun will be seven times, etc.\" - like the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, created at first and hid in the Garden of Eden. ", 
            "What did it see to state [that it is] \"a night of watchings?\" That on it He enacted greatness for the  righteous in the same way that He did so for the Jews in Egypt. And on it He rescued Hizkiyahu, and on it He rescued Chanania and his fellows, and on it He rescued Daniel from the lion's den, and on it Eliyahu and the Messiah will become great, as it is stated (Isaiah 21:12), \"The watchman said, 'the morning has come, and also the night.'\" There is a parable of a woman who was expecting her husband who took a journey to a nation overseas. He said to her, \"Let this be a sign in your hand: At the time you see that sign, know that I am coming and I have almost come.\" So [too], Israel from when Edom arose: The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"This sign will be in your hands - be infomred that I will save you on the day that I enacted your salvation and on that night. And if not, do not believe  it - the time has not approached,\" as it is stated (Isaiah 60, 22), \"I am the Lord, in its time I will hasten it.\" And I would [also] say (Haggai 2: 6-22), \"One more; it is a bit and I will shake the heavens and the earth, etc. And I will overturn the throne of kingdoms, etc.\" \"And in the same way that I overturned Egypt, so [too] will I overturn the idol worshipers,\" as it is stated, (Isaiah 60:12) \"and the nations shall be utterly destroyed.\" And I would [also] say (Job 38:13), \"To take hold of the corners of the earth.\"  "

            "\"And the Children of Israel came into the Sea on the Land\" - If they were in the sea, why \"on the Land,\" and if on land why \"into the Sea?\" Rather, from here you learn that the sea was not split for them [, the Children of Israel] until they came into it [, the Sea,] up until their noses, and only afterwards [the Sea was torn asunder and] they had dry land [in the middle]. Explained Rabbi Nehorai: If a Daughter of Israel was crossing [in the dry land created by the absence of the] Sea, and her child was in her hand, and she cried and stretched out her hand, she could reach into the Sea and grab an apple or pomegranate to give to him, as it says: (Tehillim 106:9) \"And he led them in the depths as he did in the desert\" - just as in the desert, they lacked nothing, so too in the \"depths\" they lacked nothing. And this [, that God provided for them in the desert], is the meaning of what Moshe told them (Devarim 2:7): \"These forty years, God has been with you, and you have not lacked a single thing\" - Nothing was lacking as all they had to do was call out for an object, and it appeared in front of them. Rabbi Shimon said: Even speech was not required, rather one simply had to think of an object, and it appeared for him, as it says (Tehillim 78:18): \"And they tested God in their hearts to ask food to their cravings.\" Another derivation: They did not lack anything, except for one thing: Repentance [for testing God] as it says (Hoshea 14:3): \"Takes for yourselves things and return to God.\""

            "Another interpretation: \"And then [az] Moses sang\" (Ex. 15:1). As it says: \"Her mouth opened in wisdom and the law of kindness is on her tongue\" (Proverbs 31:26). From the day that the Holy Blessed One created the world until the Israelites stood on the Sea, we do not find any human offer a song to the Holy Blessed One except Israel. God created Adam, and he did not offer a song; God saved Abraham from the fiery furnace and the kings, and he did not offer a song; and Isaac from the knife and he did not offer a song; and Jacob from the angel and from Esau and from the people of Shechem and he did not offer a song; when the Israelites came to the Sea, and it split for them, they immediately sang a song before the Holy Blessed One, as it says \"And then Moses and the Israelites sang\" which is \"Her mouth opened in wisdom.\" The Holy Blessed One said: for these I have been waiting. And there is not 'az' [then] except happiness, as it says: \"Then was our mouth filled with laughter\" (Psalms 126:2). Rabbi Yehuda son of Pazi said: What did the Israelites see to sing a song with an 'az'? Rather they said: originally the Sea was dry land, and the generation of Enoch arose and angered God with an 'az', as it says: \"Then men began to call upon the name of God\" (Gen. 4:26). And the Holy Blessed One made it a see, and plundered them, as it says: \"That calls for the waters of the sea, And pours them out upon the face of the earth\" (Amos 5:8, 9:6), and then it was a sea and became dry land for us, as it says: \"And the Israelites walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea\" (Ex. 14:29), we will praise God with an 'az' for God switched the sea to dry land, this is \"Then [az] Moses and the Israelites sang,\" and there is no 'az' except the meaning of trust, as it says: \"Then [az] you shall walk in your way securely\" (Proverbs 3:23)."

When He does justice to the gentiles. For so was it manifest at Nebuchadnezzar the wicked, because he became haughty and said, (Daniel 4:27) \"Is this Babylon not great?\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"Wicked one! You, putrid spit, become haughty and say, (ibid.) \"The strength of my power and the honor of my majesty\"? [Do you] not know that all is Mine? Greatness is mine! Power is Mine! Honor is Mine! Majesty is Mine! So did David say, (I Chronicles 29:11) \"To You, O God, is greatness, and strength, and majesty...\" And he says, (Psalms 104:1) \"God, my God, You are very great...\" Said the Holy One, blessed be He to Nebuchadnezzar, \"The little kingship given to you is Mine.\" And so Daniel said to him, (Daniel 2:37) \"For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory.\" - And you say 'the strength of my power and the honor of my majesty'?! Really, \"the King is mighty, He loves justice\", the might of the king of all kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, Who loves justice and gave it to Israel Whom He loves. And that which is written, (Psalms 99:4) \"You have established fairness\" - you have established fairness for your those who love you. For through the laws you gave them, they fight each other, and come for judgement, and then they make peace. Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Master of the world! Until when will You withhold judgment from the gentiles? [God] said to them: When their iniquities fully ripen, as it says (Isaiah 27:2) \"In that day, chant about the fruitful vineyard!\" Does anyone pick his vineyard before it is fully ripe?! Rather after it is ripe, he picks it and puts it into the vat, and then he treads on it [to press it] and sings, and they chant responsively. So did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel: Wait for Me, until Edom's iniquities become [ripe], and I will tread on it, as it states, (Psalms 60:10) \"On Edom I toss My sandal.\" I will open for you and you will respond after me. Therefore it says (Isaiah 27:2) \"In that day, chant about the fruitful vineyard!\" and (Isaiah 27:3) \"I the Lord guard it, I water it every moment.\" I am the one who watches over her to make her drink many cups, as it says, ‘I water it every moment.’ If I but come and glance at them, I obliterate them from the world, but \"Anger is not in Me,\" (Isaiah 27:4) but they are filled with anger against My children. But what will I do to them? \"I step forward and set them all on fire\" (ibid.). Rabbi Levi said: God said to the idolators: ' Israel is Mine, as it says, \"For the children of Israel are Mine as servants  (Leviticus 25:55), and anger is Mine, as it says, \"God avenges and is the master of wrath\" (Nahum 1:2), and you are filled with what is Mine against Mine?!’ As it says, Who will give me thorns and thistles will be at war! (Isaiah 27:4) Our Rabbis said that God said to them: ' If I were to change My measured way of Judgment, I would obliterate  them in a single flash of lighting, as it says, \"If I sharpen (or, 'change') the flash of My sword\" (Deut. 32:41) But what do I do? \"My hand grabs hold of Justice'  (ibid). It also says, \"Or let him take hold of My strength (Isaiah 27:5), and 'My strength' means Judgment, as it says, \"And strength to the king who loves Justice.\" (Psalms. 99:4) God said to Israel, ‘Just as I could overstep the bounds of judgment on the idolators, but I do not overstep them but hold on to judgment, so too, you must not go out of the bounds of judgment,’ as it says, \"And these are the laws.\""

            "Another explanation for zeh hadavar: “Take with you words. . .”(d’varim, Ho 14:3). This is what is meant by what is written: “I wash my palms with cleanliness and circle your altar, Yahh, to voice thanks aloud and to tell of all your miracles.” (Ps 26:6f) One might also offer bulls and rams, but exegesis says to voice thanks aloud. Accordingly, Jews say, “Ribon HaOlam (“master of the universe”), leaders sin and bring and bring a korban (“offering”) and it atones for them. The mashiach sins and brings a korban and it atones for him. We, we have no korban.” He said to them: “And if all the congregation of Yisrael stray–and the matter is hidden from the eyes of the community–and they are guilty of doing one of the negative commandments of Yahh, then, if the sin guilt for which they sinned becomes known, the community shall offer a bull of the herd as a sin offering.”(Lev 4:13f) They say to him, “We are poor and we have not what to bring for korbanot.” He says to them, “Words, I request, as it is said, ‘Take with you words and return to Yahh’ and I annul all your misdeeds.” These words are none other than divrey Torah, as it is said, “These are the d’varim that Moshe spoke to all Yisrael.(Dt 1:1) They said to him, “We do not know.” He said to them, “Weep and pray before me and I accept it. Your ancestors, when they were enslaved in Mitsrayim, it wasn’t for prayer that I redeemed them, as it is said, ‘The B’neiYisrael groaned from the work and cried out.’(Ex 2:23)In the days of Y’hoshua it wasn’t for prayer that I made miracles for them, as it is said, ‘Y’hoshua tore his garment and fell on his face before the ark of Yahh till evening.’(Jos 7:6) So what did I say to him? ‘Hold out the spear which is in your hand towards The Ai, for I give it into your hand.’(Jos 8:18) In the days of the Judges, with weeping I heard their outcry, as it is said, ‘It happened, when the B’neiYisrael cried out to Yahh on account of Midyan.’(Ju 6:7) In the days of Sh’muel it was not in prayer that I heard them, as it is said, ‘Sh’muel cried out to Yahh on behalf of Yisrael and Yahh responded to him.’(Sam 7:9) And similarly the men of Y’rushalayim, even though they had angered me, because they wept before me I had mercy on them, as it is said, ‘For thus said Yahh, “Sing out joy to Ya’akov. . .”(Jer 31:7) Oh, I request from you not sacrifices and not korbanot but words, as it is said, ‘Take with you words. . .’ This is why David said, ‘I wash my hands with cleanliness’ not intending to make an offering but to voice thanks aloud, for I am thankful to you for divrey Torah."
