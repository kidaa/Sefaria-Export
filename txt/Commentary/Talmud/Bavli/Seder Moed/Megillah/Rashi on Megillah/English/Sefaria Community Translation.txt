Line 1

The King's scribe. He was an anti-semite from the times of Cyrus as it says in Ezra "that Sitna (a play on "hatred" --Translator) wrote against building the Temple until Cyrus cancelled [the order]; he did the same in the days of Xerxes as it says "in the days of Xerxes at the beginning of his rein Sitna wrote."

That all the time that Baruch son of Neriah lived, Ezra didn't leave him and Move to Israel (Make Aliyah) - That you have to wonder, why didn't Ezra make Aliyah with Zerubavel from the days of Coresh through the seventh year of Darius the Last, after the Beit Hamikdash was constructed as it is written in Ezra, "And he came to Yerushalaim in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king, etc." (Ezra 7), and in the Midrash, that he was learning Torah from the mouth of Baruch son of Neriah in Bavel, and Baruch did not move to Israel (Make Aliyah) and he died there during those years, and that which we say above, "Baruch prophesized in the year two of Darius in Bavel, he would prophesize and send books to Jerusalem:"
