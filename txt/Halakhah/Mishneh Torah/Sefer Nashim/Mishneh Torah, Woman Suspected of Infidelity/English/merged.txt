Mishneh Torah, Woman Suspected of Infidelity

Chapter 1

The warning that is mentioned in the Torah - "And he warned his wife" - is [valid when] he tells her before witnesses, 'Do not seclude yourself with so-and-so man,' even if he is her father, her brother, a gentile, a slave or a eunuch, who is impotent.
The seclusion mentioned in the Torah - "And she secludes herself" - is [valid when] she secludes herself with the [same] man about whom [her husband] told her, 'Do not seclude yourself with him' before two witnesses. If she remained with him [long enough] for defilement, which is [the time it takes] to roast an egg and swallow it, then she is forbidden to her husband until she drinks the bitter waters that examine the matter. And at a time when there are no Sotah waters, she is forbidden to him forever and she divorces without the marriage contract
[If] he warns her about two people together, saying, "Do not seclude yourself with so-and-so and so-and-so," and she secludes herself with both of them together, and she remains with them [long enough] for defilement, then even if [the two men] are her brothers or her father and brother, she is forbidden [to her husband] until she drinks [the Sotah waters].
[If] he tells her before two [witnesses], "Do not speak with so-and-so," that is not a valid warning. And even if she secludes herself with him before witnesses and remains with him [long enough] for defilement, she is not forbidden to him and does not drink through this warning.
And similarly, if he told her, "Do not seclude yourself with him," and he sees her speaking with him, this is not a valid seclusion, and she is not forbidden [to her husband] and she does not drink [the Sotah waters]. And similarly, if [the husband] did not warn her first and witnesses come and testify that she secluded herself with someone and that she remained with him [long enough] for defilement, she is not forbidden to her husband and she does not drink [the Sotah waters].
