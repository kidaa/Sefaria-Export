Even though they are all received traditions in our hands from our teacher Moses, and reason is inclined to them from the principles of the Torah, it appears that regarding these he was commanded.  He added for Noah [the prohibition on eating] the limb of a live animal, as it is said \"but flesh in its life its blood you shall not eat.\"  We find seven commandments.  And so was the matter in the whole world until Abraham.  Abraham came and he was commanded, in addition to these, with circumcision.  And he prayed shaharit.  And Isaac separated a tithe and added another prayer as the day wanes.  And Jacob added the [fobidden] sinew and prayed arvit.  And in Egypt Amram was commanded with additional commandments, until Moses our teacher came and the Torah was completed by him."
