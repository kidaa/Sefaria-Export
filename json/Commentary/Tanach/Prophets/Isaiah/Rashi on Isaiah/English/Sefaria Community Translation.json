                "\"Upon your walls, oh Jerusalem\" Our rabbis explained this according to its implied meaning - angels who recall her destruction before Gd in order that He rebuild her. What did they say? \"You will rise, You will have mercy on Zion...\" (Tehillim 102:14) \"For the Lord has chosen Zion...\" (Tehillim 132:13) as it says in tractate Menachot. Yonatan translates 'your walls' as the forefathers who guard us like a wall."
