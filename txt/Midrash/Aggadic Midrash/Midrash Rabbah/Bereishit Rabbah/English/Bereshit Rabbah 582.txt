"The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, etc." (Eccl. 1:5) R. Abba said: Do we then not know that the sun rises and the sun goes down? But the meaning is that before the Holy One, blessed be He, causes the sun of one righteous man to set, He causes the sun of another righteous man to rise. Thus, on the day that R. Akiba died our Teacher was born, and they applied to him the verse, “The sun also rises, and the sun goes down.” On the day that our Teacher died R. Adda b. Ahabah was born, and they applied the same verse to him. On the day that R. Adda b. Ahabah died R. Abin was born, and the same was applied to him. On the day that R. Abin died, his son R. Abin was born. On the day that R. Abin [junior] died Abba Hoshaya of Traya was born. On the day that Abba Hoshaya of Traya died R. Hoshaya was born, and that verse was applied to him. Before the Holy One, blessed be He, caused Moses' sun to set, He caused Joshua's sun to rise, as it says, “And the Lord said unto Moses: Take Joshua the son of Nun, etc. (Num.27:18). Before the sun of Joshua set, the sun of Othniel, the son of Kenaz, rose, as it says, “And Othniel the son of Kenaz took it” (Josh. 15:17). Before Eli's sun set the sun of Samuel rose, as it says, “And the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down to sleep in the Temple of the Lord” (1 Sam. 3:3). Said R. Johanan: Like a calf without blemish. Before the Holy One, blessed be He, allowed Sarah's sun to set, He caused that of Rebekah to rise. Thus we first read, “Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children (Gen. 22:20), and after that, ”AND THE LIFE OF SARAH WAS A HUNDRED YEARS, etc.”Rabbi Akiva was sitting and expounding, and the audience was dozing. He wanted to wake them up, [so] he said, "What [merit] did Esther see that she could rule over one hundred twenty seven provinces? But let Esther, who was the descendant of Sarah, who lived to one hundred twenty seven, come and rule over one hundred and twenty seven provinces."


"Abraham came to mourn for Sarah." - Where did he come from? Rabbi Levi said: He came from the burial site of Terach [his father] to Sarah. Rabbi Jose said to [Rabbi Levi]: But [what about the fact that] the burial of Terach occurred two years before Sarah's burial‽ Rather, Where did he come from? From Mount Moriah.
