There are eight degrees of Tzedakah, one higher than the other. The highest degree of all is where
one strengthens the hands of an Israelite who faces poverty, giving him a gift or a loan, entering
into a business partnership with him, or giving him a job in order to strengthen his hand and to
prevent him from becoming an object of Tzedakah. It is with regard to this that Scripture says:
“Then thou shalt strengthen him: Yea, though he be a stranger or a sojourner: that he may live with
thee” (Lev, 25:35). The meaning is: Strengthen him before he falls and needs to be supported by
others.
