Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

...[Mishnah] transfers on shabbos are two that are four inside and two that are four outside. How is this?
...[if a] poor man is standing outside, and the home owner is inside. If the poor man extends his hand inside and imparts [something] into the hand of the home owner or took it [from him]. The poor man is at fault and the home owner is exempt [from violation]. 
...If the home owner extends his hand outside and imparts [something] into the hand of the poor man or took it [from him] the house owner is at fault and the home owner is exempt [from violation] 
...If the poor man extends his had inside and takes from the house owner or imparts [something], and he withdraws [his hand back] out, both are exempt.
... If the house owner extends his hand out and takes from the poor person or imparts [something] and he enters [his hand back inside], both are exempt.
...Gemara: It was taught there [in Mishna] Shevuot; there are two that are four

Rav Kahana Said...
















<b> We shall return to you, Yiziot HaShabbat </b>
MISHNA: What do we light with and what don't we light with?
 We do not light with <i> lechesh </i> (inner wool-like bark of a cedar tree), and not with <i> Chosen </i> ("uncarded" flax) and not with <i>challach</i> (inferior silk) and not with a wick of an <i>edan</i>(inner wool bark of a willow tree) and not with a <i>desert wick</i> (from a desert reed)
and not with a seaweed <i>zefet</i> (melted liquified pitch) and not with <i>sha'ava</i> (liquified wax (excluding candles)) and not with <i>cottonseed oil </i> and not with <i>burnt oil</i> and not with <i>tail fa</i>t and not with<i> tallow</i>.
 Nachum the Mede says...
 we light with boiled tallow.  And the sages say ...
whether or not it is boiled, we do not light with it.
GEMARA: Lechesh [mentioned in the mishnah] is cedar bark.  -?!- ...
Cedar bark is just wood.  ...
[Rather, we are referring to] the stringy substance that is in it [the bark].  
:And not with chosen:
R' Yosef says...
 [chosen is] n'oret of the flax. ...
 Abaye replies ...
"but it is written
 (Isaiah 1:31) 'and the chason will become n'oret'".  (That implies that chosen is not yet n'oret.) ...
 Rather Abaye says ...
[chosen is] flax that is beaten but not combed.
and not with chalach: 
Shmuel said,...
 "I asked the seafarers and they said...
 that its name is 'culcha'."...
 Rav Yitzchak bar Zeira said...
 "[Its name is] 'gushkra'". ...
Ravin and Abaye were sitting before Rabana Nehemiah, the brother of the Exilarch. they saw that he was wearing silk....
 Ravin said to Abaye, ...
"this is the calach of our Mishna."...
 Abaye replied...
 "we call it 'Shira parnda'." ...

Daf 21a

















































Rav Huna said: The wicks and oils that the Sages said [we] don't light with them on Shabbat - we don't light
with them on Chanukkah, whether on Shabbat [of Chanukkah] or on the weekdays. Rava said: What is the reasoning of Rav Huna? He is thinking:
If it goes out, he is [yet] obligated to [relight] it, and [one] is permitted to use its light. And Rav Chisda said: [We] light with them on the weekdays [of Chanukkah] but not on Shabbat [of Chanukkah] - he is thinking: If it goes out,...

Daf 21b

[one] is not obligated to [relight] it and [one] is permitted to use its light;
Rabbi Zera said that Rav Matna said, and some say it [thus]: Rabbi Zera said that Rav said:
The wicks and oils that the Sages said [we] don't light with them on Shabbat, we [may] light with them on Chanukkah, whether on Shabbat [of Chanukkah] or on the weekdays.
 Rabbi Yirmiyah said:
What is Rav's reasoning? He is thinking: ...
If it goes out, [one] is not obligated to [relight] it, and [one] is forbidden from using its light.
The Sages said this [teaching] before Abbaye in the name of Rabbi Yirmiyah, and he did not accept it;
when Ravin came, they said this [teaching] before Abbaye in the name of Rabbi Yochanan and he accepted it.
He said, ...
"If I had merited, I would have learned [i.e., accepted] the teaching from the outset! -
 But behold, [in the end] he learned [i.e., accepted] it! -...
 the practical implication is for the [virtues of] the [rehearsed] learning of one's youth. 
  "If it goes out, [one] is not obligated to [relight] it" -...
 they threw [a contradictory source] against it:
"Its mitzvah is from when the sun sets until the foot is gone from the marketplace".
Is this not [implying] that if it goes one, [one] is obligated to [relight] it?!
No, [it's implying] that if he didn't light [immediately after sunset], he [still] lights [until "the foot is gone..."];
 alternatively, for [indicating] ...
it's measuring [of duration].
"Until the foot is gone from the marketplace" - and until how [late is that]? Rabba
bar Rav Chana said that Rabbi Yochanan said:
 Until the foot of the Tarmodian [caste] is gone. ...
Our Sages taught:
 The mitzvah of Chanukkah is a [single] candle for [each] man and his household,
and those who are scrupulous: A candle for each and every one, and the scrupulous among
 and the scrupulous among the scrupulous: Beit Shammai say:
 The first day he lights eight, from here going [forward], he goes on reducing, 
and Beit Hillel says:
The first day he lights one, from here going [forward], he goes on adding.
Ulla said: ...
They argued about it - two Amoraim from the West [i.e., Eretz Yisrael]: Rabbi Yosi ben Avin and Rabbi Yosi ben Zevida.
One said: the reasoning of Beit Shammai is: to correspond to the days which are entering,and the reasoning of Beit Hillel is: to correspond to the days which are going out;
 [the other] one said:
the reasoning of Beit Shammai is: to correspond to the bulls [offered on Sukkot]  and the reasoning of Beit Hillel is that [we] raise up in holiness and [we] do not lower. 
 Rabbah bar Bar Chanah said that Rabbi Yochanan said: 
There were two elder [scholars] in Tzidon, one did like the words of Beit Shammai, and [the other] one did like the words of Beit Hillel. This [one] gave reason for his words [i.e., actions] - corresponding to the bulls [offered] on Sukkot, and this [other] one gavereason for his words: that [we] raise up in holiness and [we] do not lower.  
 Our Sages taught:
The Chanukkah candle - it is a mitzvah to place it at the door of his house, on the outside,
and if he was living in an attic [i.e., with no direct access to public areas], he places it in a window adjoining the public area
and in times of danger [i.e., persecution], he places it on his table and it is sufficient for him.  
Rava said:...
 He needs another light [in order] to use its [i.e., the Chanukkah candles'] light
 and if there is a hearth-fire, he doesn't need [another light], but if he is a wealthy man, even though there is a hearth-fire, he does need another light.
What is Chanukkah? ...
That [which] our Sages taught:
On the 25th of Kislev - the days of Chanukkah, they are eight, not to eulogize on them and not to fast on them,
for when the Greeks entered the Temple, they polluted all the oils in the Temple, and when the Hasmonean dynasty overcame and defeated them, they checked and they found but one cruse of oil that was set in place with the seal of the High Priest, but there was in it only [enough] to light a single day. A miracle was done with it, and they lit from it for eight days. 
The following year [the Sages] fixed those [days], making them holidays for praise and thanksgiving.
 We taught there [in a Mishnah]: 
A spark that goes out from under the hammer, [if] it went out and damaged, he [i.e., the smith] is liable.
 If a camel was loaded with flax and passes in the public domain and the flax enters [i.e., protrudes] into a store and it catches fire from the storekeeper's candle and sets the whole area [lit.: group of buildings] ablaze, the camel owner is liable.
 If the storekeeper set his candle outside, the storekeeper is liable.
Rabbi Yehudah says:...
 With a Chanukkah candle, he is exempt....
 Ravina said: This implies...
 [that for] the Chanukkah candle, it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to set it within ten handbredths [from the ground],
for if it occurred to you [that it is acceptable] above ten handbreadths, let him [i.e., the camel owner] say to him [i.e., the storekeeper]: ...
"you should have set it above camel and rider!" - ...
But perhaps,...
if we trouble him so much, he will come to refrain from the <i>mitzvah</i>!  ...
Rav Kahana said: Rav Natan bar Manyumei expounded in the name of Rav Tanchum...

Daf 22a

a Chanukkah candle which one placed above twenty cubits is invalid, like a <i>sukkah</i> and a <i>mavoi</i>
And Rav Kahana said:Rav Natan bar Manyumei expounded in the name of Rav Tanchum: That which is written,
(Genesis 37:24): "And the cistern is empty, there is no water in it"? 
From the implication of what is said,
"the cistern is empty", do I not know that there is no water in it?
 Rather what is it teaching?
that there is not water in it, but there are snakes and scorpions in it! 
 Rabbah said:...
 The Chanukkah candle - it is a <i>mitzvah</i> to set it in the hand-breadth abutting the door (lit. - "opening")
 And where does he set it?
 Rav Acha son of Rava said: 
 on the right; Rav Shmuel from Difti said:...
 on the left. 
The <i>halachah</i> is that it is placed on the left, so that there will be the Chanukkah candle on the left and the <i>mezuzah</i> on the right.
 Rav Yehudah said that Rav Assi said:
It is forbidden to count money opposite the Chanukkah candle. 
When I said this before Shmuel, he said to me: 
Is there holinessin the candle?! 
 Rav Yosef attacked this: Is there holiness
Is there holiness in blood, 
yet it is taught:...
 "And he shall pour out...and he shall cover" (Leviticus 17:13) - he covers with that [i.e., his hand] which he poured, so that he may not cover it with his foot, so that <i>mitzvot</i> not will not become degraded for him.
  Here also, [the reason is] so that <i>mitzvot</i> not become degraded to him.
 They asked of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: ...
What is [the law regarding] utilizing the <i>sukkah</i> decorations all seven days [of the festival]?
He said to them: 
Behold they said: It is forbidden to count money opposite the Chanukkah candle.
Rav Yosef said:...
 G-d of Avraham!
 They have made a [Tannatic] teaching dependend upon a non-[Tannaitic] teaching, [for the law regarding]...
 <i>sukkah</i> is taught [by Tannaim] and [the law regarding] <i>Chanukkah</i> is not taught [by Tannaim],
for it is taught [in a <i>baraita</i>]:...
 If he covered it with <i>schach</i> in accordance with its law and crowned it with fabrics and decorated sheets and hung in it nuts, peaches, almonds, pomegranates, clusters of grapes and crowns of rain-stalks, wines, oils, and fine flour - it is forbidden to utilize of the until the night after the last holiday of the festival. [However], if he conditioned it, everything is according to his condition.  
  Rather, Rav Yosef said: 
Blood is the basis [lit.: father, archetype] of all of them....
 It was said [by Amora'im]: Rav said, 
[we] do not light from candle to candle and Shmu'el said, 
[we] light;...
 Rav said ...
[we] do not untie <i>tzitzit</i> from garment to [tie them on another] garment and Shmu'el said
 [we] do untie <i>tzitzit</i> from garment to [tie them on another] garment; ...
 Rav said ...
the law is not like Rabbi Shim'on regarding dragging [a bench on Shabbat] and Shmu'el said
the law is like Rabbi Shim'on regarding dragging.
Said Abbaye: 
 In all matters Master [i.e., Rabbah] did like Rav except for there three, which he did like Shmu'el: 
[we] light from candle to candle, and [we] untie <i>tzitzit</i> from garment to [tie on another] garment and the law is like Rabbi Shim'on regarding dragging, 
 for it is taught [in a <i>baraita</i>]: ...
Rabbi Shim'on says: A man many drag a bed,
 A man many drag a bed, a chair or a bench [on Shabbat], as long as he does not intend to make a furrow. 
A certain rabbinic [scholar] sat before Rav Ada bar Ahavah, sitting and saying
 [that] the reasoning of Rav is because of degrading the <i>mitzvah</i>. ...
He [Rav Ada bar Ahavah] said to them: ...
don't heed him! The reasoning of Rav is because of reducing the <i>mitzvah</i>! - 
What is [the practical difference] between them? ...
There is a practical difference between them:
When one lights [directly] from flame to flame....
 The one who said because of degrading the <i>mitzvah</i> - from flame to flame one may light;the one who says because of reducing the <i>mitzvah</i> - from flame to flame is also forbidden!
Rav Avia responded [bringing a <i>baraita</i>:...
 A <i>Sela</i> [coin of a specific denomination] of

Daf 22b

<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> - [we] don't weight against it golden <i>dinars</i> [coins of another denomination], even [in order] to redeem with them  other <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i>
It's alright if you say that Rav and Shmu'el disputed about lighting from flame to flame, but with a matchstick [even] Shmu'el forbade - this [<i>baraita</i>] would not be a refutation,
but if you say that [Shmu'el] also permitted [lighting from candle to candle] with a matchstick - this [<i>baraita</i>] would be a refutation [of Shmu'el]! 
 Rabbah said
: it is a [rabbinical prohibitive] decree - lest one not precisely balance one's measures, and spend them [the excess coins] for ordinary [i.e., non-sacred] things. 
 Rav Sheshet responded [bringing a <i>baraita</i>]: 
(Leviticus 24:3) "Outside the veil of testimony...shall he [Aaron] arrange..."; now, does He [G-d] need its light?!
Was it not that all forty years that Yisrael walked in the desert, they walked only by His light? 
Rather, it is testimony to all inhabitants of the world that the <i>Shechina</i> dwells in Israel!
What is that testimony?...
 Rav said: it is the
western light [of the <i>menorah</i>, in which he [the <i>kohen</i>] places a measure of oil equal to the the others, yet from it he lights and with it he concludes!
 Here, since the candles are fixed [in the <i>menorah</i>, it is not possible unless he takes them and lights - this is a difficulty both for the one who says [that Rav's reasoning is] because of degrading the <i>mitzvah</i> and for the one who says [that Rav's reasoning is] because of reducing the <i>mitzvah</i>!
 Rav Papa explained: it had long wicks.
 In the end, for the one who says [that Rav 's reasoning is] because of reducing the <i>mitvah</i>, it is difficult!
  Indeed, [for him] it is difficult! 
 What was [resolved] regarding it [i.e., the question of whether we can light from candle to candle]? 
 Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: We can see that if lighting
 We can see that if light, it accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i>, {we may] light from candle to candle, but if setting [the lights] in place accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i>, [we may] not light from candle to candle...
 for it was asked
of them [in the Beit Midrash]: Does lighting accomplish the <i>mitzvah</i> or does setting in place accomplish the <i>mitzvah</i>?  Come and hear,
for Rava said: ...
If one was holding a Chanukkah candle and standing, he has done nothing
  Learn from this...
 that setting in place accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i>! 
 There,
 the one who sees may say [to himself: he holds it because] he needs its light! 
 Come and hear, ...
for Rava said: ...
If he lit it inside and brought it outside, he has done nothing!
It is fine if you say that lighting accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i> - we need lighting in its place, <b>that's</b> why he has done nothing;but if you say setting in place accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i> - why has he done nothing?
 there, also, 
the one who sees may say [to himself] he lit it for his own needs!  Come and hear, for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi

Daf 23a

A lamp that was burning continuously all day long - when Shabbat goes out, one extiguishes and relights it. 
It's fine if you say lighting accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i>, it [works] beautifully; but if you say setting in place accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i> - this "one extinguishes and relights" - 
"one extinguishes and raises and sets in place and relights" is what it needs to say!  
And further: since we bless "Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to <b>light</b> the Chanukkah light," learn from this
that lighting accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i>. [Indeed,] learn from this! 
And now that we are saying that lighting accomplishes the <i>mitzvah</i>, if a deaf-mute, an insane person or a minor lit it, he has done nothing. 
A woman certainly lights, for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: 
Women are obligated regarding the Chanukkah light, for they, too, were [central] in the miracle. 
Rav Sheshet said
- a lodger is obligated regarding the Chanukkah light. 
Rabbi Zeira said: 
At first, when I was at my master's house, I partnered with my host by [giving] coins. 
After I married, I said, 
now I certainly don't need [to do so], for my wife is lighting for me in my house.
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: 
All oils are good for the candle, and olive oil is the choicest. 
Abbaye said: 
At first the Master [i.e., Rabbah] would go to lengths for sesame oil, he said, 
its light is drawn out more; 
when he heard that [teaching] of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, he would go to lengths for olive oil, saying: 
its light is clearer. 
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi also said: 
All the oils are good for ink, and olive oil is the choicest. 
They asked: 
for mixing or for smoke [i.e., pigment]? 
Come and here: Rav Shmuel bar Zutrei taught: 
All oils are good for ink and olive oil is the choicest, 
whether for mixing or for smoke. Rav Shmuel bar Zutra teaches thus: 
All smokes are good for ink and olive oil is the choicest. 
Rav Huna said: 
all saps are good for ink, and <i>ketaf</i> sap is the best. 
Rabbi Chiya bar Ashi said that Rav said: 
One who lights the Chanukkah light must bless,
and Rav Yirmiyah said: 
one who sees the Chanukkah light must bless. 
Rav Yehudah said: 
On the first day, the one who sees blesses two [blessings] and the one who lights blesses three [blessings]; 
from here on out, the one who lights blesses two [blessings] and the one who sees blesses one [blessing]. 
Which does he omit? -
He omits <i>z'man</i> [i.e., <i>Shehecheyanu</i>. - 
Let us omit the miracle [blessing]! - 
There was [a part of the miracle] every day.
What does he bless? 
He blesses "Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the light of Chanukkah". - 
And where did He command us?
- Rav Aviya said: 
[it's] from "Do not depart..." (Deuteronomy 17:11); 
Rav Nechemia said: 
[it's from] "Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders and and they will say to you" (Deuteronomy 32:7). 
Rav Amram responded [quoting a <i>baraita</i>]: 
<i>Demai</i> - [we] may make <i>eiruvim</i> with it and [we] may make <i>shitufim</i> with it and [we] must recite a blessing over it and [we] must recite the <i>zimun</i> [before <i>Birkat HaMazon</i> over it and [we] may separate [<i>challah</i>] from it [while] naked and during sunset. 
Not, if you say
that any [<i>mitzvah</i>] of rabbinic origin requires a blessing, here, when he is standing naked, how does he recite a blessing? 
Behold, we require [the condition implied by] "and your camp will be holy"(Deuteronomy 23:15) [to be fulfilled], but it is not! - 
Abbaye said: 
Certainty [regarding a <i>mitzvah</i>] of rabbinic origin requires a blessing; [yet] a doubt [regarding a <i>mitzvah</i> of rabbinic origin does not require a blessing. 
- Behold, the second day of <i>Yom Tov</i>, which is [observed due to] a doubt of rabbinic origin, yet requires a blessing? 
- There, it is so as not to denigrate it [i.e., the second day]. 
Rava said [regarding no blessing for <i>challah</i> taken from <i>demai</i>]: 
The majority of unlearned people [nevertheless] separate their tithes.   
Rav Huna said:
A courtyard which has two openings requires two candles. 
Rava said: 
He said this only [where the two openings are approached] from two different directions, but [if they are approached] from one direction, it is not necessary. 
What is the reason? 
If you say, because of suspicion - suspicion of whom? 
If you say, supspicion [on the part] of the word [i.e., non-locals] - then even [if the two openings are approached] from one direction, also require [lighting at both openings]; if you say suspicion of townsfolk, even [if the two openings are approached] from one direction, also do not require [lighting at both openings]! 
- In fact, [it's] because of suspicion of townsfolk, and sometimes they pass this [opening] and they don't pass this [other opening] and they say, 
just like in this opening he didn't light, in that [other] opening he also didn't light.  
- And from where do you said that we are concerned regarding suspicion? For it was taught [in a <i>baraita</i>]: Rabbi Shim'on said:
Because of four things did the Torah say to leave <i>pe'ah</i> at the end of one's field: 
because of robbing the poor and because of idling the poor and because of suspicion and because of (Leviticus 19:9) "Do not finish [reaping]". 
Because of robbing the poor - that the householder will not see an opportune [lit. "open"] moment and say to his poor relative, 
'behold, this is <i>pe'ah</i>.'

Daf 23b

And because of idling the poor - so that the poor will not sit
and wait, [thinking] "now the householder will set aside <i>pe'ah</i>. And because of
suspicion - that passersby do not say, "Let a curse
come upon the man who does not leave <i>pe'ah</i> in his field. And because of
"do not finish [reaping]" - but aren't they <b>all</b> because of "don't finish [reaping]"?
Rava said: [it's] because of the cheaters.   Rav Yitzchak
bar Redifah said that Rav Huna said: A candle that has two openings [lit. "mouths"]
counts for two people. Rava said: [If] one filled a bowl
[with] oil and surrounded it with wicks - if he upended a vessel upon in [like a lid], it counts
for a number of people; if he didn't upend a vessel upon it - he's made it
into a kind of bonfire and it doesn't count even for one person.
Rav said: It's simple that [if he can afford either] a light for his home [i.e., for Shabbat] and the Chanukkah light, a light
for his home is preferred, because of [considerations of] domestic tranquility. A light for his home and [wine for] sanctification
of the day, a light for his home is preferred, because of domestic tranquility; Rava
asked: The Chanukkah candle and sanctification of the day, what is [the ruling]? Is sanctification of the day
preferred, because it is a frequent[practice], or perhaps the Chanukkah candle is prefered, because of
publicizing the miracle? After he asked, he came back and resolved [lit. "simplified"] it:
The Chanukkah candle is preferred, because of publicizing the miracle.

Who bet with each other and said,
"Anyone who can go and make Hillel annoyed, he may take four hundred <em>zuzim</em>."
One of them said,
"I shall annoy him."
That very day was the eve of the Sabbath, and Hillel was bathing his head.
He went and passed by the opening of his home and said,
"Is Hillel here?
Is Hillel here?"
He wrapped himself [in a towel] and exited to meet him.
He said to him, 
"My son, what is your request?"
He said to him,
"I have a question to ask."
He said to him,
"Ask, my son, ask."
[He asked,] "What is the reason that the Babylonians heads are wide?"
He said to him,
"My son, you are asking a great question. It is because they do not have intelligent midwives [and so the heads do not come out correctly]."
He went and waited an hour. He came back and said,
"Is Hillel here?
Is Hillel here?"
He wrapped himself [in a towel] and went out to greet him.
He said to him,
"My son, what is your request?"
He said to him,
"I have a question to ask."
He said to him,
"Ask, my son, ask."
[He asked,] "What is the reason that the Ethiopians' eyes are bleary?"
He said to him,
"My son, a big question you have asked. It is because the live surrounded by sand [which reflects sun into their eyes]."
He went and waited an hour. He returned and said,
"Is Hillel here?
Is Hillel here?"
He wrapped himself [in a towel] and went out to meet him.
He said to him,
"My son, what is your request?"
He said to him,
"I have a question to ask."
He said to him,
"Ask, my son, ask."
[He asked,] "What is the reason that the Africans have wide feet?"
He said to him,
"My son, a big question you have asked. It is because the live between the bays."
He said to him,
"I have many questions to ask, but I will forgo them, so that you may not get mad."
He wrapped himself up and sat before him. He said to him,
"All the questions that you have to ask, ask."
He said to him,
"Are you the Hillel that they call the prince of Israel?"
He said to him,
"Yes."
He said to him,
"If you are him, then I wish that there will not be many in Israel like you!"
He said to him,
"My son,  for what reason?"
He said to him,
"For because of you, I lost four-hundred <em>zuz</em>!"
He said to him,
"Be careful with your spirit like Hillel, whom you lost because of him four-hundred <em>zuz</em>, because even for four-hundred <em>zuz</em>, Hillel will not get angry."
It was taught in a baraita that 
a non-Jew came before Shammai and asked him,
"How many Torahs do you have?" 
Shammai responded, 
"Two, the Written Torah and the Oral Torah." 
The non-Jew said, 
"I believe in the Written Torah, but not in the Oral Torah. 
Convert me and teach me only the Written Torah." 
Shammai berated the non-Jew and chased him out
The non-Jew came before Hillel and Hillel converted him. One day Hillel taught him 
the alef-bet, and the next day he switched the names of the letters.
He said to Hillel,
"Didn't you teach me the opposite yesterday?" 
Hillel responded, 
"Just as you trust me in the instruction of letters, 
so to you must trust me in the instruction of Torah."
Another time a non-Jew came before Shammai and said, 
"I will convert if you can teach me the entire Torah while I stand on one foot."
Shammai pushed the non-Jews aside with the ruler that was in his hand. 
The non-Jew came before Hillel and Hillel converted him 
saying, 
"What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor, that is the entire Torah, the rest is just commentary, now go and study."
Another time a non-Jew was passing behind the Beit Midrash and hear the voice of the sofer who was saying,
"These are the garments you shall make , a breastplate, and an ephod" (Exodus 28:4)
The non-Jews asked, 
"Who are these garments for?" 
The sofer responded, 
"For the Cohen Gadol." The same non-Jews said to himself, 
"I will go and convert so that they will make me the Cohen Gadol." 
The non-Jew came before Shammai and said, 
"Convert me on the condition that you make me Cohen Gadol." 
Shammai pushed him aside with the ruler that was in his hand. 
The non-Jew came before Hillel, and Hillel converted him. 
Hillel said to him, 
"We cannot anoint someone unless they learn the ceremonies of kingship, 
go and learn the ceremonies of kingship." 
The new convert went and learned the ceremonies of kingship. When he arrived at the verse, "and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death" (Numbers 1:51), he asked, 
"Who is this verse speaking about?" 
Hillel answered him, 
"It's even relevant to David, King of Israel." 
The new convert made himself a "kal v'chomer": 
Israel are called Children of God, and out of God's love for them, they are called 
the first born children of God. If even in regards to them it is said, 
"and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death..." how much more so for me who comes to the Jewish people with his staff and bag.
He came before Shammai and told him:
"How could I have ever qualified to be a high priest?
The Torah states:
'and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death'"
He came before Hillel and told him:
"You are humble Hillel, may blessings rest on your head for moving me under the wings of the divine presence."
Eventually the three [converts] happened to meet somewhere and said:
"Shammai's strictness would have killed us. Hillel's humility brought us under the wings of the divine presence."



When a man is brought before the [heavenly] court he is asked:
"Were you trustworthy in business? Did you set time for Torah [study]? Did you try to have kids? Did you hope for the Messiah? Did you argue intelligently? Did you understand things based on other things?"

Since Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Shimon sat [together], and Rabbi Yehudah ben Gerim sat with them.
Rabbi Yehuda opened and said, 
"How fine are the deeds of [the Roman] nation; 
they set up markets, they set up bridges, they set up bathhouses."
Rabbi Yose was quiet.
Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai answered and said, 
"All that they set up, they didn't  set up except for their own needs; they  set up markets to place prostitutes in them, bathhouses to pamper themselves, bridges to take taxes from them."
Rabbi Yehudah ben Gerim went and told over their words and they were heard by the government.
[The government officials] said, 
"Yehuda that elevated [us] should be elevated, Yose that was quiet should be exiled to Tsippori, Shimon that disgraced [us] should be killed."
He and his son went [and] hid in the study hall, 
every day, his wife would bring them bread and a container of water and they ate. 
When the decree became more pronounced, he said to his son,
"women have weak resolve; maybe [the Romans] will distress her and she will reveal [our location]."
They went and hid in a cave.
A miracle occurred [and] a carob tree and a spring of water were created for them.
And they would take off their clothes and would sit up to their necks in sand; the whole day they would study; at the time of prayers they would get dressed, cover themselves and pray; and [then] they would go back and take off their clothes so that they would not get worn out.
 They sat for twelve years in the cave.
Eliyahu came and stood at the entrance of the cave [and] said,
"Who will inform Bar Yochai that the Caeser has died and that his decree has been annulled?"
They came out; 
they saw people that were plowing and planting. [Rabbi Shimon] said,
"They are leaving over eternal life and involving themselves with temporary life."
Every place upon which they would set their eyes would immediately burn.
A Heavenly voice came out and said to them,
"Did you come out [of the cave] to destroy my world? 
Go back to your cave!"
They returned and went [back]; 
they sat for twelve months of a year;
they [then] said, 
"the judgment of the wicked is twelve months in <i>Gehinnom</i>."
A Heavenly voice came out and said, 
"go out from your cave."



As the [sun was setting] on the eve of Shabbat, they saw an hold man holding two bundles of hyssops and running at twilight.
They said to him,
"what are these to you?"
He said to them,
"For the honor of the Shabbat."
 [They said back,] "Would one not suffice?"
[He responded,] "One corresponding to Exodus 20:7), 'Remember' and one corresponding to (Deuteronomy 5:11) 'Guard.'" 
[Rabbi Shimon] said to his son,
"See, how beloved the commandments are to Israel." 
[And so] their minds were put at ease....






He said, "Since a miracle took place, I will go and fix a matter, as it is written (Genesis 33:18),
'And Ya'akov returned intact' (and Rav said [about that], 
"Intact in his body, intact in his money and intact in his[knowledge] of Torah.")
'and he graced the face of the city.'" (Rav said [about that], 
"He instituted a coin." And Shmuel said
"He set up marketplaces." And Rabbi Yochanan said, 
"He set up bathhouses.")

Mishna: Do not place an egg next to the kettle in order to roast it slightly, and do not crack it on cloths (heated by the sun); R' permits this (the cracking). And do not insulate it with sand or dirt in order to roast it. It once happened that the men of Tiberia brought a pipe of cold water into a canal of hot water. The Sages said to them, "If the [hot waters] came on Shabbos, they are forbidden to bathe in and to drink from; if they came on Yom Tov, they are forbidden to bathe in but permitted to drink from."
Gemara: they asked: if it roasts, then what [is the punishment]? R' Yosef says, if it roasts, one is obligated to bring a sin-offering. Mar the son of Ravina says, this is even taught in an explicit Mishna.

Daf 39a

"Anything that came into hot water (i.e was cooked) before Shabbos may be soaked in hot water on Shabbos, and anything that did not come into hot water before Shabbos may be rinsed (but not soaked) in hot water on Shabbos, except for old herring and Spanish tuna, for rinsing them is completing their Melacha." Thus it is learned.
"And do not burst it on cloths": But is it not taught in a Mishna, "One may put a dish into a pit in order to protect it, and hot water into cold water in order to cool them, and cold water out in the sun in order to warm them"? Let us say that [the Mishna] follows R' Yosi and not the Rabbis. R' Nachman says, everyone agrees [cooking] in the sun is permitted, and everyone agrees cooking on fire products is forbidden; when do they argue? Regarding products of the sun: [the Rabbis] hold that products of the sun will lead to products of the fire, while [R' Yosi] holds that we do not need to enact that safeguard.
"And do not insulate it in sand [etc.]": And let R' Yosi argue on this too! Rabbah says, there was a decree, lest one come to insulate in hot ashes. Rav Yosef says, [there was a decree] because one might come to uproot dirt from the ground. What is the practical difference between [Rabbah and Rav Yosef]? There is a difference: [regarding insulation in] hard earth.

Why does the fragrance of a cooked Shabbat dish diffuse?
He said to him
We have a certain spice called Shevet (dill) which we place in the food and it's fragrance diffuses.

Give us some of it

Gemara: What's an example?
Says Rav Safra:

and says Rav Safra:
One time, I went there [Israel] and they fed me some [of R. Abba's chicken], and if it weren't for Rabbi Abba, who gave me three year old wine, I would have been forced to [throw up]
Rabbi Yochanan spit from Babalonian kutah.
Says Rav Yosef:
and we spit from Rabbi Abba's chicken.
And also says Rav Aza:
One time, I went there [Israel] and made Babylonian kutah, and all the sick people of the West asked me for it.

Daf 146a

The Israelites who stood at Mount Sinai, their lustfulness departed; the idolaters, who did not stand at Mount Sinai, their lustfulness* did not depart.  R. Aha son of Raba asked R. Ashi: What about proselytes? Though they were not present, their guiding stars3  were present, as it is written, [I make this covenant... not with you alone,] but with those who are standing here with us this day before the Lord our God and those who are not with us here this day. 

*The assertion is that in the Garden of Eden the serpent infected humanity with lustfulness for which the revelation at Sinai and acceptance of the moral teachings of the Torah was an antidote.

"And similarly the Eve of Pesach:
Rabbi Yochanan says: One can consecrate his Pesach offering on the Sabbath, and his Chagigah offering on Yom Tov. Let us say this [following statement] supports him: "And similarly on the Eve of Pesach in Jerusalem which falls out on the Sabbath, he leaves his cloak by [the animal seller], takes his Pesach offering, and calculates pricing after the holiday. [This is not a support for Rabbi Yochanan], here what are we dealing with? When others are counted with him [as a group] for his Pesach offering, for before [even setting it aside], it is considered consecrated and set. But [that can't be the case, for] don't we teach: "One cannot be counted [for a group] for an animal optimally on a holiday"! It is different in our case [of Pesach], for he is accustomed to doing this, it is as if he was counted already [before the holiday]. But [that shouldn't make a difference,] doesn't Rabbi Hoshiah teach: "One who goes to a shepherd he always goes to, and he gives him a lamb for his Pesach offering, and he consecrates it, [showing that he still must consecrate it]! There too, since he is used to going to him, it is as if he had consecrated it from the start [before the holiday]. But it states that he [must] consecrate it! [No,] that's consecration of the highest Rabbinical level. Did Rabbi Yochanan really say that [one can consecrate these animals]? But rabbi Yochanan said: "The halacha is according to the anonymous Mishna", and it is taught [in a Mishna] "One cannot consecrate, promise the evaluation of oneself, make vows for donation, and setting aside Teruma and Maaser." These were said about holidays, all the more so for the Sabbath! This is not a question, here it is referring to debts where there is a set time for them [such as the Pesach offering], here it is talking about debts that do not have a set time [such as Maaser].
Mishna: One can count his guests and his extra portions [of food] verbally, but not from something written. One can raffle off [portions] with his sons and family members, as long as the intention is not to pit a larger portion against a smaller portion. One may raffle the sacrifices [for the priests] on holidays, but not the meal portions.

Daf 149a

Gemara: What is the reason [that one cannot count from a written document]? Rav Bibi said: It is a rabbinical decree lest one comes to erase. Abaye said: It is a rabbinical decree lest one comes to read ordinary [business] documents. What is the [halachic] difference between them? There is a [halachic] difference between them, where it is written on the wall high up. According to the one who says "lest one comes to erase", we would not be concerned [in this case]. According to the one who says "lest one comes to read...", we would be concerned. And according to the one who says "lest one comes to erase", let him be concerned for "lest one come to read..."! And furthermore,would we not be concerned [in that case] of "lest one comes to erase"? But it is taught [in a Mishna], "One may not read from the light of a lamp, and Rabbah said that even if it is higher than two [human] lengths, even higher than two ox-goads, even higher than ten houses, even in this case, one cannot read," [and so we see that the decree applies no matter how high]! Rather, this is the [halachic] difference between them, where it is written on the wall low down. According to the one who says, "lest one comes to erase", we are concerned. According to the one who says "lest one comes to read...", we are not concerned, a wall and a document will not be confused. And the one who says "lest one comes to read...", let him be concerned of "lest one comes to erase"! Rather, this is the [halachic] difference between them, where it is engraved on a tablet or a board. According to the one who says "lest one comes to erase", we are not concerned. According to the on who says "lest one comes to read...", we would be concerned. And the one who says "lest he comes to erase", let him be concerned of "lest he comes to read..."! If you'll say that [he believes] a tablet or a board would not be confused for a document, but it is taught [in a baraita], "One can count [guests], how many will be inside and how many will be outside, and how many portions will he place before them, [only] from something written upon a wall, but not something written upon a tablet or board"! What is the case? If you say it is something written [in ink on the wall/tablet], what is the difference here [with a wall] or here [with a tablet]? Rather, is it not engraved [on the wall/tablet]? But it states, "something written UPON the wall, but not something written UPON a tablet or board"! Rather, really it is written on a wall, high up [as first suggested]. And your question because of Rabbah, Rabbah is but [a contender] in a Tannaic argument, as it is taught [in a baraita], "One can count his guests and his extra portions verbally, but not from something written. Rav Acha permitted [counting] from something written upon a wall." What is the case? If you say it is on the wall low down, let [Rav Acha] be concerned of "lest on come to erase"! Rather, it is surely on the wall, high up. And learn from it that Rabbah is [a contender] in a Tannaic argument, learn from it. And this Tannaic argument is like another Tannaic argument, as it is taught [in a baraita], "One may not look into a mirror on the Sabbath [lest one feels the need to cut ones hair, and does it despite the Sabbath]. Rabbi Meir permitted a mirror that is set on a wall." Why does it matter if it is set [or not]? Because while [he is trying to find a scissor] he will remember [it is the Sabbath]. If it is not set, he will also remember! [Whether it is set should not make a difference!] Here, we are dealing with a metal mirror, and according to that of Rabbi Nachman, in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha, for Rabbi Nachman said in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha, "Why did they say that a metal mirror is prohibited? Because a person will cut thin hairs using it['s sharp edges]." Our rabbis taught [in a baraita], "Writing that goes under a painting or a bust, it is forbidden to read it on the Sabbath. And the bust itself is forbidden to gaze at even during the week,  as it says, 'Do not turn to idols...' [Leviticus 19:4]." How is this learned? Rabbi Chanin said, "Turn not to that which is from your own minds."
"One can raffle off [portions] with his sons..."
With his sons and with his household, yes, but with others, no. What is the reason? It is like that of Rav Yehuda in the name of Shmuel, for Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel, "Members of a group [eating together], and who are very strict on each other [as to how much food they lend to each other], are transgressing [the prohibitions of] measuring, weighing, and counting, browwing and repaying on the festival,

Daf 149b

and according to Beit Hillel, even [the prohibition of] interest." If so, his sons and his household as well [should be forbidden for those reasons]! His sons and his household are within the reasoning of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav, for Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, "One is permitted to lend to his sons and his household with interest, so that they can taste the [bitter] taste of interest." If [we allow prohibited actions for educational purposes], pitting a larger portion against a smaller portion [should be permitted] as well [to allow them to taste the bitter taste of gambling]! Yes, indeed [that is correct], and it is missing [words], and this is how it should be taught: One can raffle off [portions] with his sons and his household for the table, even to pit a larger portion against a smaller portion." What is the reason? It is like that of Rav Yehuda in the name of Rav [that this is permitted for educational purposes]. With his sons and his household, yes, but with others, no. What it the reason? Like that of Rav Yehuda in the name of Shmuel, "A larger portion against a smaller portion, it is prohibited [from being raffled off] to others even during the week." What is the reason? Because of [the prohibition of] gambling.
"Priests can draw lots..."
What does it mean, "but not for portions"? Rav Yaakov, son of the daughter of Yaakov, said: [It means] "but not the portions of the [previous] week's [sacrifices] on the festival." That's obvious! [No,] what would you have said? Since it is written, "For your nation is like the priests who fight," [Hosea 4:4] even the portions of the week [should be raffled off] as well [to prevent fights]. It teaches us [that this is not so.]
And Rav Yaakov, son of the daughter of Yaakov [also] said: Anyone whose fellow gets punished because of him, is not allowed in to the borders of the Holy One, blessed be He. How do we know this? If you'll say it's because of what's written, "And God said, 'Who will entice Achav, so he will go up and fall at Ramot-Gilad?' and one said this and one said that, and a spirit went out and stood before God, and he said, 'I will entice him'... And he said, 'I will go out and I will be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.' And He said, 'You will entice, and you will be able. Go out and do it.'" [I Kings 22:20-22]. And we say [on that], what is this "spirit"? The spirit of Navot [whom Achav had killed]. And what is this "go out"? Rav said: "Go out from my borders" [thus, the spirit was banned from God's borders because he caused Achav's downfall]. But perhaps over there, the reason was because of that which is written, "He who is deceitful shall not dwell within" [Psalms 101:7]? Rather, [the source of Rav Yaakov's statement is] from here, "You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor. You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised...." [Habakkuk 2:16]: "You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor": That is Nevuchadnezzar. "You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised": That is Tzidkiyah [and since he caused Nevuchadnezzar to be punished, he is considered "uncircumcised"]. First of all, the whole verse is referring to Nevuchadnezzar! And furthermore, what should the righteous Tzidkiyah have done for him? For Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: "When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man" [and thus, he was forced to punish him]! Rather, [Rav Yaakov's source is] from here, "Punishment to the righteous is not good" [Proverbs 17:26], "not good" can only mean "wicked", [and this applies to the righteous who punish others], and it is written, "For You are not a God Who desires wickedness; evil does not abide with You" [Psalms 5:5]. [Meaning], God, You are righteous, and evil shall not live in Your abode.
How does "Chalashim" [in the mishnah] connote "lots"? As it is written, "How have you fallen from heaven, morning star? You have been cut down to earth, you who cast lots [cholesh] on nations" [Isaiah 14:12]. Rabbah bar Rav Huna said: This teaches that [Nevuchadnezzar] would cast lots on the royal staff to figure out which day was theirs for homosexual relations. And it is written, "All of the kings of nations, all of them... [lay in honor, each man to his house]" [Isaiah 14:18]. Rabbi Yochanan said, "That they rested from homosexual relations."
And Rabbi Yochanan said, "As long as that wicked man lived, not a single creature had joy in its mouth, as it says, "All the land rested, became tranquil, they opened [their mouth] in song," [Isaiah 14:7] implying that until now, there had not been singing.
And Rav Yitzchak said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan: It is forbidden to stand in the house of that wicked man, as it says, "...and wild goats shall dance there" [Isaiah 13:21].
And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, "When that wicked man sought to do such [rape] to that righteous man, he extended his foreskin 300 cubits, and would twist it around in front of the whole party, as it says, "You have become sated more from disgrace than from honor. You, too, drink and become of the uncircumcised...." [Habakkuk 2:16], "uncircumcised" in numerical value is 300.
And Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, "When that wicked man went down to hell, all the descenders of hell  trembled. They said, 'Perhaps he has come to rule over them, or to be weak like them,' as it says, "Have you too become weak like us? Have you come to rule over us?" [Isaiah 14:10]. A heavenly voice came out and said, "Whom do you surpass with beauty? Go down with, and you shall be laid with the uncircumcised" [Ezekiel 32:19].
"How the oppressor has ceased! [How] the fury has ceased!" [Isaiah 14:4]. Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, "This nation has ceased, which had said

Daf 150a

'Measure it out and bring it [as taxes].'" And some say, '[That nation] had said, 'Bring very much, without measure.'
"Excessive greatness was added to me" [Daniel 4:33]. Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav Yirmiya bar Abba, this teaches that he rode on a male lion, with a snake tied to its head, to fulfill that which is said, "And also the beasts of the field I gave to him to serve him" [Jeremiah 27:6]
Mishna: One may not hire workers on the Sabbath, nor ask his fellow to hire workers for him. One may not wait at the "techum" border for nightfall [at the end of the Sabbath] so that he can hire workers for himself, nor to gather fruits [as soon as the Sabbath ends]. But one may wait till sunset in order to guard [his field], and [then] to bring in fruits with his hands. Abbah Shaul said a rule: Whatever I can say [for others to do], I can wait til sunset to do.
Gemara: What's the difference between him and his fellow? [It's obvious that if he can't, he also cannot ask his fellow!] Rav Pappa said, "A non-Jewish fellow." Rav Ashi challenged, "Asking a non-Jew [to do work on the Sabbath] is a shvut [i.e. a protective prohibition, and so this is obvious that one cannot do this as well as well]!" Rather, Rav Ashi said, "Even if it is a Jewish fellow, this [Mishna] is teaching us that [although] one may not ask his fellow to hire workers for him, he can [hint and] say, 'Let us see if you will stand with me in the evening.'"
And who is the Mishna [according to]? It is like that of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha, as it is taught [in a Baraita], "One may not [hint and] say to his fellow [on the Sabbath to hire him as a worker], 'Let us see if you will stand with me in the evening.' Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, 'One may say to his fellow, 'Let us see if you will stand with me in the evening.'" Rabba bar Bar Chana said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, "The law is like Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha." And Rabba bar Bar Chana said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, "What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Karcha? Because it is written, '...by not pursuing your affairs and speaking words' [Isaiah 58:13]. Speech is prohibited. Thoughts are permitted."
Rav Acha bar Rav Huna asked about a contradiction to Rava, "Did Rabbi Yochanan really say that speech is prohibited but thoughts are permitted, showing that thought is not like speech? But didn't Rabba bar Bar Chana say in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, 'It is permitted to think [in learning] in any place except for in the bathhouse and in the bathroom, [showing that thoughts are like speech, by being forbidden in some areas].'" It is different there, for we require "and your camp shall be holy" [Deuteronomy 23:15], and there is not [in the case of a bathroom].
But here too it is written, "Forbidden speech [davar] shall not be seen in you" [showing that it is only prohibited while speaking]! That [part of the verse] is needed for that of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda said, "One may not say the Shema reading in front of a naked gentile." Why [specifically] a case of a gentile? Even if it were a Jew, it would also [be forbidden]! It was a "not necessary" statement: It's not necessary to state that [in front] of a Jew, it is forbidden. But for a gentile, since it is written, "[lovers] whose members were like the members of donkeys," [Ezekiel 23:20] I would say it would be fine [to say Shema in front of them, like it is fine to say Shema in front of a donkey.] This is teaching us [that they are considered the same]. I'll say that is indeed so [that one can say the Shema because of the verse in Ezekiel]! [Why do we dismiss it?] Scripture says, "They did not see the nakedness of their father" [Genesis 9:23]. [This verse refers to Noah, a gentile.]
And is speech really forbidden? But Rav Chisda and Rav Hamnuna both said, "Calculations for religious purposes is permitted to be calculated on the Sabbath." And Rabbi Elazar said, "One can decide on charity monies for the poor on the Sabbath." And Rav Yaakov bar Idi said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, "One may attend [discussion of] life and death matters, and communal emergencies, and one may go to the synagogue to attend to communal matters, on the Sabbath." And Rav Shmuel bar Nachmeni said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, "One may go to theaters, circuses, and business/legal halls to attend to communal matters on the Sabbath." And the school of Menashe taught, "One may arrange marriages of young girls for engagement on the Sabbath, and for the young boy to teach the book, and to teach a trade." [So we see, speaking about forbidden things is allowed on the Sabbath!] Scripture says, "...by not pursuing your affairs and speaking words" [Isaiah 58:13], it is your affairs that are prohibited, but heavenly affairs are permitted [to talk about].
Rav Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel, "Calculations of the guests, and of what something [would cost], it is permissible to calculate these on the Sabbath. It was also taught like this [in a Baraita], "Calculations of past [costs], and of what future [costs] will be, it is forbidden from calculating these. Of the guests,

Daf 150b

and of what something would [cost], it is permitted to calculate these." And they contradicted it [from this]: One may calculate costs of unnecessary expenditures, but one may not calculate expenditures that are needed on the Sabbath. How so? One may say to his fellow, "I have hired such and such number of workers for the field." "I have spent such and such amount of dinars for this house." However, one may not say, "I have spent such and such amount, and such and such amount I will spend." [Thus, we see that one may talk about past expenditures!] According to your own reasoning [your own source] itself is difficult! Rather, this one is when one has the wages of the employer with him, and this one is where he does not have the wages of the employer with him.
One may not wait [at the edge of the techum until nightfall]:

Daf 151a



Daf 151b























Mishnah - One should not close the eyes of a dead person on shabbat, nor on a weekday while the soul is departing.  
And one who closes while the soul departs - behold this one spills blood.
Gemara - Our rabbis taught:  ...
One who closes him with the departure of the soul - behold this one spills blood.  
An analogy: to a lamp that is going out, someone puts his finger on it - immediately it goes out.

Daf 152a



Daf 152b



Daf 153a






















We learned there in a Mishnah, Rebbe Eliezer says
Repent (do teshuva) one day before your death
The students of Rebbe Eliezer asked him
But does a person know which day he will die
He said to them
All the more so, Let a person repent today, he may die tomorrow, and he will find all his days in penitence
