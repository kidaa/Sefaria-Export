Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

A woman is acquired in three ways and acquires herself in two ways. 
[She is] acquired through money, a document and relations.  
Through money: Beit Shammai say [this means] a dinar or the equivalent of a dinar. And Beit Hillel say a pruta or an equivalent of a pruta. 
How much is a pruta? One eight of an Italian issar. 
She acquires herself through a bill of divorce or if her husband dies. 
A Yevamah is acquired through relations and acquires herself through halitzah or the death of the Yavam. 
GEMARAH: A woman is acquired
What is the difference here that it is written "a woman is acquired" and [the later mishna which states] "the man sanctifies"?
Because the Tanna wanted to write "money", and money we have learned by analogy of the verb TAKE לקח - from the field of Ephron.
It is written here (Deut. 22:13) "when a man takes a woman" and it is written there (Gen. 23:13) "I gave the money of the field, take it from me".
And taking is called acquisition as it is written "the field which Abraham bought"

Daf 2b

Also "fields will be bought with money" (Jer. 32:44), the Tanna wrote "the woman is acquired".
Q: The Tanna should have written there (2:1) "the man acquires"? A: first he used biblical language and then rabbinical language.
What is the meaning of the rabbinical language? - he makes her forbidden for the whole world, like property of the Temple.
Q: The Tanna should have written here (1:1) "the man acquires"?
A: He wanted to write at the end "she acquires herself", he wrote in the beginning also a reference to herself.
Q: He should have written "the man acquires and makes the [woman]acquire herself"?
A: Since in the case of the husband's death it is not him, but rather God who makes the wife acquire herself.
Or if you wish you could say
If it was written "[the man] acquires" I would have thought that it means even against her will, therefore the Tanna wrote "the woman is acquired" - with her consent only

Daf 29a
















What is meant by "All the commandments of the son are upon the father..."?
Maybe [it means] that women are exempt from all the commandments that a son is obligated to fulfill for his father? [But there is a contradictory] Baraita:
"[When the verse says] 'a man' (Leviticus 19:3), only a man [is explicitly commanded]. From where do we derive [the obligation of] women [as well]?
When the verse states 'a man [is commanded to] fear (plural) his mother and father' (ibid.) [the plural form of 'fear' implies] two [distinct individuals that are obligated]". -?!-
Says Rav Yehudah
"This is what was meant (by the Mishnah when it says "All the commandments of the son are upon the father..."):
All the commandments that are incumbent upon a parent to do for his son, men (i.e. the fathers) are obligated to fulfill while women (i.e. the mothers) are exempt".
A Baraita states:
"A father is obligated to circumcise, redeem, teach Torah to, find a wife for, and teach a trade to his son".
There are those that say
"[there is] even [an obligation to show his son] how to swim".t
Rabbi Yehuda Says "all that does not teach his son craft [or trade] teaches him to steal"
To steal, do you think? [will really be a result of not teaching your son to trade]?
Rather,
or as if he taught him how to steal. 
To circumcise, how do you know?
As it is written
"and he circumcised his son"
and where the father did not circumcise him, the court is obligated to circumcise him. As it is written, "Circumcise for yourselves - all the males." Where the court did not circumcise 
She, How do you know that She is not obligated?
As it is written: As god commanded him, him and not her.
We find: immediately, for generations how do we know?
It was taught in the academy of Rabbi Yishmoael
Anywhere that it says "G-d commanded" It is with passion, immediately, and for generations. 
Passion, as it is written, "and he commanded Joshua - And be strong and be courageous [referring to circumcision]." Immediately, and for generations, as it is written, "from the day which G-d commanded, and further your generations" 

Daf 29b



Daf 30a







one [of them] says

Daf 30b


...What is "the enemies in the gate"?
...Said Rabbi Chiyya bar Abba:
...Even a parent and child, or rabbi and disciple, engaging in Torah in one gate, are made enemies of each other, but they don’t move from there until they become those who love each other, as it says, "...Vahev in Sufah" (Numbers 21:14) -- read it not "in Sufah", but "in Sofah" [ie, "at the end"].


































"All Miswoth of the Father on the Son", etc. - What is the meaning of "All Miswoth of the Father on the Son"?
If you will say [that it means] All the Miswoth that the Father is obligated to do for his son, [then how could] women be obligated?!  Surely it is taught in a beraita,
"The father is obligated with regard to his son to circumcise him and to redeem him" - [this implies that] his father is indeed [obligated, but] his mother is not [obligated].

Daf 31b

brings to the next world
Rabbi Abahu said 

Daf 32a



Daf 32b



Daf 33a










"It is not fitting for artisans to stand for Torah scholars while they are doing their work".
Is it really not?
But we are taught:
"All the artisans of Jerusalem would stand before them and greet them,
'Our brothers from so-and-so, come in peace!'"
Rabi Yochanan said,
"Before them [the artisans] stand, but not before Torah scholars."
Rabi Yosi bar Avin said,
"Come and see how precious a mitzvah is at its proper time, because [the artisans] stand before them, but not before Torah scholars."
Perhaps there is different because if so [if you would not greet them], you would cause them to stumble [sin] in the future [because they will be discouraged from coming]!

Daf 33b



Daf 34a

and tefillin.
And what are positive commandments that are not time dependent? Mezuza, building a fence, returning a lost object and sending away the mother bird.
Is this a general rule?
But there are [the commandments of] eating Matza [on Pesach], happiness [on holidays] and assembling which are positive commandments that are not time dependent, yet women are obligated [in these].
Furthermore,
there are [the commandments of] learning Torah, having children and redeeming the [firstborn] son that are not time dependent, yet women are exempt?
Rabbi Yochanon answers:
We do not learn [conclusions about specific cases] based on general rules, even when the general rule specifies an exception.
For we learned in a Mishna:
"We can make an eiruv or a shituf out of any food except water and salt."
[Is that really true that only water and salt are invalid for an eiruv and a shituf] and nothing else?
But mushrooms and triffles are also [invalid. Yet the mishna said any food is acceptable except salt and water!]
Rather [we must conclude that] we do not learn [conclusions about specific cases] based on general rules, even when the general rule specifies an exception.
"and positive commandments that are time dependent, women are exempt."
From where do we know this?
We derive it from Tefillin.
Just like by Tefillin women are exempt, so to by all time dependant positive commandments women are exempt.
And Tefillin is derived from [the commandment of] learning Torah.
Just like by [the commandment of] learning Torah women are exempt, so too by Tefillin women are exempt.
[Instead of deriving whether women are obligated in Tefillin by connecting the law of Tefillin to the previous verse, the commandment to learn Torah,] let us connect Tefillin to the [subsequent verse, which contains the] commandment of Mezuzah?
Tefillin is connected (i.e adjacent) to the commandment of learning Torah in both the first and second paragraphs [of Shema].
but Tefillin is not connected (i.e. adjacent) to the commandment of Mezuzah in the second paragraph [of Shema. Therefore we derive whether  or not women are obligated in Tefillin from the commandment of learning Torah rather than the commandment of Mezuzah.]
And let us connect the commandment of Mezuzah to the commandment to learn Torah [which immediately precedes Mezuzah in the second paragraph of Shema and conclude that just as women are no obligated to learn Torah they are also not obligated to have Mezuzot]?
Don't consider that, as it's written (right after the commandment of Mezuzah (Deut 11:20) "And you shall write them [i.e. these words which were mentioned in the previous verse] on the doorposts of your house and of your gates." The next verse states:) (Duet 11:21) "So that your days are increased..." [Evidently, the commandment of Mezuzah increases life.] Do men need life but not women!? [That would be ridicoulous. This teaches us that women are obligated in Mezuzah and therefore no connection should be made between Mezuzah and studying Torah.
But there is the commandment of Succah which is a time dependent commandment as it's written (Lev. 23:42) "You shall dwell in Succoth for 7 days..."
The reason [women are exempt] is because the Merciful One wrote [in the continuation of that verse (Lev. 23:42) "all that are] home-born (Ha'ezrach) [in Yisrael shall dwell in Succoth..." The word Ha'ezrach is masculine] to exclude women [from the commandment of Succah]. But had it not been for this [exclusion based on the word Ha'ezrach] women would be obligated [in Succah!? Even without the word Ha'ezrach women should be exempt from Succah because it's a time dependent positive commandment?
Abaye answers:
It's necessary [for the Torah to explicitly exclude women from the commandment of Succah.]
[Because otherwise] I might have thought [that]
since it's written (Lev. 23:42) "You shall dwell in Succoth..." that you must "dwell" [in Succoth] just as you live [at home]. Just like living [at home] is husband and wife together, so too [dwelling in a] Succah is husband and wife together. [And therefore I would have concluded that despite the fact that in general women are exempt from time dependent positive commandments, Succah is an exception. Therefore it was necessary for the Torah to explicitly exclude women from the commandment of Succah.

Our Mishnah:
Anyone who does one mitzvah, it is good for them, and their days will be lengthened, and they inherit the land. ...
And anyone who does not do one mitzvah, it is not good for them, and their days will not be lengthened, and they will not inherit the land.
Gemara. 
They raised a contradiction [from a mishnah]:
"These are the things that a person eats their fruits in this world but the principal remains for them in the world to come. These are they: 
Honouring parents, acts of lovingkindness, welcoming guests, making peace between people. And the study of Torah is equal to them all." (Mishnah Peah 1:1)
Rav Yehudah said: This is what [the mishnah] meant to say: ...
Anyone who does one additional mitzvah over their innocence, it is good for them and they are similar to one who upholds the entire Torah.
But this implies that [they would get all these] with any one?!
Rav Shemaya said:
That is to say, if they were equal, it counterbalances.
[Baraita:] "And anyone who does one additional mitzvah over his innocence, it is good for them."
They raised a contradiction [from a baraita]: 
"Anyone whose innocence outnumbers their sins, it is bad for them, and they are similar to one who burns the entire Torah and not one single letter remains from it. 
And anyone whose sins outnumber their innocence, it is good for them, and they are similar to someone who upheld the entire Torah not missing a single letter from it!"
Abaye said: 
Our mishnah makes for them a good day [in this world] and a bad day [in the world to come].
Rava said: 
Who is this? It is Rabbi Ya'akov, who said
that there is no reward for a mitzvah in this world.
As it is taught [in a baraita]: Rabbi Ya'akov says: 
There is no mitzvah written in the Torah that you are given its reward with it without depending on the resurrection of the dead. 
About honouring parents, it is written, "In order that your days will be lengthened, and in order that it would be good for you" (Deuteronomy 5:15). About sending away the mother bird, it is written, "In order that it will be good for you and your days will be lengthened" (Deuteronomy 22:7).
For when his father says to him, 
"Go up to the attic and bring me chicks!" And he goes up to the attic, sends away the mother [bird], and takes the children, but on his return, he falls and dies. Where is the goodness of this one's days? Where are the lengthening of this one's days?
Rather,
"In order that it be good for you"—in the world which is all good; "And in order that your days will be lengthened"—in the world which is all long.
Perhaps this has never happened?
Rabbi Ya'akov saw it happen.
But perhaps he was thinking about a sin?
God does not act upon bad thoughts.
But perhaps he was thinking about idolatry, and it is written, "So that you abandon the house of Israel in your minds" (Ezekiel 14:5)?
He also [could have done this], and this is what [Rabbi Ya'akov] said: 
If you should think there is reward for a mitzvah in this world, why didn't the mitzvot protect him, such that he wouldn't have [bad] thoughts?
But didn't Rabbi Elazar say:
Agents of a mitzvah are not damaged?
There, in their going, is different.
But didn't Rabbi Elazar say: 
Agents of a mitzvah are not damaged—neither in their going nor in their returning?
It was a rickety ladder that is susceptible to damaging,
and in any case which is susceptible to damaging we don't rely on a miracle. As it is written, "Shmuel said: How will I go? If Shaul hears he will kill me!" (1 Samuel 16:2).

But hey, the Torah  wrote “shalom”! Said Rav Nachman: The “vav” of shalom is (written) broken.

Every time Rabbi Chiya bar Abba fell upon his face (in the Tachanun prayer) he used to say, ‘The Merciful save me from the Yetzer Ha'Rah. One day his wife overheard him. ‘Let me see,’ she reflected, ‘it is so many years that he has separated from me: why then should he say that?’ One day, while he was studying in his garden, she adorned herself with a scarf and strolled in front of him.  ‘Who are you?’ he asked. ‘I am Cheruta, and have returned today,’ she replied. He desired her. Said she to him, ‘Bring me that pomegranate from the uppermost branch.’ He jumped up, went, and brought it to her. When he re-entered his house, his wife was firing the oven,whereupon he went and sat in it. ‘What is this?’ she asked. He told her what had happened.‘It was I,’ she told him; but he paid no heed to her until she gave him proof. ‘Nevertheless,’ said he, ‘my intention was evil.’ That righteous man fasted all his life, until he died from that very death.
