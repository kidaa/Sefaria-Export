Kitzur Baal Haturim on Genesis

Chapter 1



Verse 1

<b>In the beginning, created:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'On Rosh Hashanah was created (the world).' <i>Bereishit</i> (In the beginning) is the acronym of <i><b>be</b>rishona <b>ra</b>ah <b>E</b>lohim <b>she</b>yikablu <b>yi</b>srael <b>T</b>orah</i> (first God saw that Israel would accept the Torah). The last letters of <i>Bereishi<b>t</b> bar<b>a</b> Elohi<b>m</b></i> (In the beginning, God created) form the acronym, <i>emmet</i> (truth), [which] teaches that God created the world with truth, as it is stated (Psalms 119:160), "The beginning of Your word is truth;" and so [too], there are many verses, which the last letters of of its words form the acronym, <i>emmet</i>. 

Verse 2

<b>And the spirit of God was hovering:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'this is the spirit of messiah.'

Verse 3



Verse 4

<b>The light:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'in the Torah' and adds up to six hundred and thirteen (the traditional numerical sum of the Torah's commandments).
<b><i>E<u>t</u> haoh<u>r</u> k<u>i</u> to<u>v</u></i> (the light, that it was good):</b> The last letters [of which] form the acronym, <i>brit</i> (covenant). <b>And God saw the light that it was good and He separated:</b> From here [we learn], that we do not make a blessing on the candle [at the Havdalah (separation) service] until we derive use from its light; and [that last phrase] adds up to the numerical equivalent of 'and He separated - we separate during the year at the end of the Shabbats.'

Verse 5



Verse 6



Verse 7

<b>From above the firmament:</b> There are two [places this appears] according to the tradition: here and the other is (Ezekiel 1:25), "and there was a voice from above the firmament," in the chariot [apparition] of Ezekiel. And in the same way that we don't teach about 'the story of creation' in public, so [too] do we not teach about 'the story of the chariot' [in public].

Verse 10



Verse 11



Verse 12

<b><u>Ma</u>zria <u>ze</u>ra <u>le</u>mineihu (that gives off seed according to its species):</b> forms the acronym, <i>mazal</i> ('constellation'); as there is no grass that does not have a 'constellation' above [governing] it.

Verse 13



Verse 14

<b>Luminaries (<i>meorot</i>):</b> is [written in its] incomplete spelling [meaning that it lacks the letter <i>vav</i>], since only the sun was created to give light. And the moon was only created so that [people] would not worship the sun, [which might have been the case] had it been alone.

Verse 22

<b>And the birds:</b> There are three [places this appears] according to the tradition: [here, where it states,] "and the birds shall increase;" "and the birds ate them" (Genesis 40:17); "this is the law of the beasts and the birds" (Leviticus 11:46). [This is] a hint to that which they said (Chullin 63b), "pure birds are more numerous than impure birds;" this is [what is alluded to by] "and the birds shall increase," meaning that they will be more, [but] which? "And the birds ate them," meaning those that are pure, and so [too], "this is the law, etc." refers to the pure ones.

Verse 26



Verse 27

<b><i>Haadam</i> (man):</b> [has the same] letters [as] <i>adamah</i> (earth), since he was created from the earth. <i>Adam</i> is the acronym of <i><b>e</b>fer, <b>da</b>m, <b>ma</b>rah</i> (ash, blood, bile).

Verse 28

<b>And have dominion (<i>ouredu</i>) upon the fish of the sea:</b> There are two [places this appears] according to the tradition: here and the other is "and go down (<i>ouredu</i>) to Gat of the Philistines" (Amos 6:2). If you will have merit, you will have dominion even over the fish of the seas; but, if not, you will go down to Gat; meaning to say, you will be subjugated to the Philistines.

Verse 29

<b>Fruit of the tree (<i>pri etz</i>):</b> There are two [places this appears] according to the tradition: [here, where it states,] that has within it the fruit of the tree;" [and] "fruit of a beautiful tree" (<i>pri etz hadar</i>) [in Leviticus 23:40]. This is a hint for the opinion that holds that the tree that Adam ate from here was a citron (<i>etrog</i>) [since that is what the verse in Leviticus refers to]. 
<b>Male:</b> has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'blessing.' Female has a numerical equivalent (<i>gematria</i>) of 'in a curse.' 

Verse 30



Verse 31

<b><i><u>Y</u>om <u>ha</u>shishi <u>va</u>yekhulu <u>ha</u>shamayim</i> (the sixth day. And He finished the skies):</b> [forms] the acronym of [God's] name [that consists] of four letters, with which he [here] sealed the story of creation. And so [too in Psalms 96:11] "<i><b>yi</b>smechu <b>ha</b>shamayim <b>ve</b>tagel <b>ha</b>arets</i>" ("Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice") [forms] the acronym of [God's] name [that consists] of four letters, with which he [also] sealed the world, with the name of four letters.
