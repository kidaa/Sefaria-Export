Shir HaKavod

Line 1

I make pleasant songs, and weave verses; Because for You my soul longs.
My soul desires to be in Your hand’s shade; To know all of Your deepest mystery.
When I speak of Your Glory; My heart yearns for Your love.
Therefore I will speak of Your Glories; And Your Name I will glorify in songs of love.
I will recount Your Glory, though I have not seen You; I describe You though I have not known You.
In Your prophet's writings, in Your servants' speech; You depicted the beauty of Your glorious splendor.
Your greatness and might; They portrayed in accordance with Your actions.
They depicted you, though You are not as they depicted; They characterized you according to Your doings.
They allegorized you in many visions; Behold, You are one in all depictions.
They saw in You old age and youth; They represented Your hair as both whitened and black.
Old age on the day of judgment, youth on the day of battle; Like a man of war who has many talents.
He wore the helmet of redemption on His head; His right arm and holy left arm brought redemption.

He beautifies Himself through me, because He desires me; And He shall be for me a crown of beauty.
His head is like pure gold; On His forehead is inscribed His honored holy name.

The place of justice, His splendid beauty; May He elevate it above his greatest joy.

His splendor is on me, and my splendor is on Him; He is close to me when I call to him.

May you nod your head to my blessing; May you accept it like the finest spices.
May my contemplation be sweet to You, For my soul yearns for You.
