Daf 3a



And is it possible that biblically the Gett is null and because of modest and promiscuous women we will permit a married woman?
Yes! He who betrothes does so according to the will of the Rabbis, and the Rabbis have nullified his marriage.
Ravina said to Rav Ashi:
When he betrothed with money, it is understandable. Betrothal with intercourse, what is there to say?
The Rabbis equated his intercourse to a promiscuous act of intercourse.

Rav Chanan bar Rav says: 
All are aware for what purpose a bride goes into the chuppah, but anyone who fouls one's mouth and says something disgraceful, even if that person had a divine decree of seventy years of goodness sealed and granted, that would be reversed and that person would be sentenced to seventy bad years.

Happy are those that observe justice, that do charity at all times (Ps. 10:3). ...Is it possible to do charity at all times? 
Our Rabbis of Jamnia, and according to others R. Eliezer, interpreted it: ...
"This refers to one who supports his sons and daughters when they are minors." ...
R. Samuel b. Nachmeni said: ...
"This refers to one who raises an orphan boy and girl in his house and gives them in marriage."

... Our sages taught


Our Sages taught [in a Baraita]:


























































... 
... 
... 
...  Mar 'Ukva had a poor person in his neighborhood that he [Mar] threw 4 zuz into his door-socket every day.
... One day, he [the poor person] said, 
..."Let me go and see who does this kindness for me."
On that that, Mar 'Ukva was late coming home from the Beit Midrash, and his wife came to meet him. 
... As soon as the poor man heard them at the door, he ran out after them.
... They ran from him [since they did not want him to know who they were], into a [large] oven that had just been raked. The ashes began to burn Mar 'Ukva's feet. 
... His wife said to him, 
... "Lift up your feet and place them on mine."
... Mar 'Ukva was upset [with what she said, and he realized that his wife was  more holy than him, since her feet were not burned].
... She said to him,
... "My mitzvot happen inside the house, and I can help people directly." [By giving bread and food to the poor who arrive at the door.] 
... And what was the point of all that? [Hiding in the oven, etc.]
... Since Mar Zutra the son of Tuvia said in the name of Rav, and others say [it was] that Rav Huna the son of Bizna said in the name of Rabi Shimon the Pious, and others say [that it was] Rabi Yochanan [who said] in the name of Rabi Shimon Bar Yochai:
... "It is better for a person to throw themselves into a fiery furnace than to whiten someones face [embarrass someone else] in public."
... We learn this from [the story of] Tammar, 
... as it is written [in the Tanach] "When she was brought forth [she privately sent word to her father-in-law.]"
...Mar ‘Ukva had a poor person in his neighborhood, to whom he would give 400 Zuz every Erev Yom Kippur. 
...One day, he [Mar ‘Ukva] sent the money [to the poor man] with his son. His son came back and said, 
...“He does not need this.” 
...He said: 
...“What did you see [to make you say this?]” 
...He replied, “I saw [the poor man's’ sons] spraying old wine in front of him [in order to make the room smell nice.]” 
...He said, “How sensitive [this poor man] is!”
...Mar ‘Ukva then doubled the money, and sent it back to the poor man. 
... When he [Mar 'Ukva] was about to die, he said:
...He said, “Bring me my bank account records!”
... Written in his accounts, he found that he had 7,000 gold Sianki pieces. 
He said, “No amount will be enough to take with me to the next world.” [lit. “The road is long, and the provisions few.”]
He then distributed half of his wealth as tzedaka. 
What - how could he do that!?
Didn’t Rabi Elai say, “In Usha [the city] it was established: when distributing money ...
- a person may only donate one-fifth of their income.”
These words - only apply in a person's life, for perhaps a person might lose their property. But, in death - this rule doesn’t apply.

Gemara: Rav taught
A minor who is divorced with a get she does not receive her Ketubah and all

Daf 101a

If she is sent away [divorced] with a get she is required to wait three months [before she can remarry].
Why
All this has all been taught
[In the case of] the minor girl who had been married off by her mother or brothers and who then rejects her husband, he [the former husband] is allowed to [marry] her close relatives and she is allowed to [marry] his close relatives and [she] is not forbidden [to marry] from the priesthood.
[On the other hand], if he gave her a get, then he is forbidden to her close relatives and she is forbidden to his close relatives, and she is forbidden [to marry] from the priesthood.
She [the minor receiving the get] is required to wait 3 months [before remarrying] and [it was to teach this additional rule] that it was necessary to teach these [the previous rules]. 
Is it like Rabbi Eliezer says?
[that] the actions of a minor girl [mean] nothing and her husband is not entitled to what she finds and [he is ] not [entitled] to the work of her hands and he cannot nullify her vows, and he is not her heir, and he cannot become impure for her [to attend her funeral].
Is it all as he said [that she is not a wife in any way except that she can reject her husband?]
[But] isn't she [the minor] as his wife in every way except that she can invalidate her marriage with him? Rabbi Y'hoshua says
The actions of are nothing [but] her husband is entitled to what she finds and to the work of her hands and he can invalidate her vows and he is her heir and he can become impure for her [funeral].
Is it all as he said [that she is a wife in every way except she can reject her husband].
Here she is like a wife in all ways except that she is able to leave the marriage by the minor girl's right to reject a marriage set up by the mother or the brothers.
Is Rav speaking like Rabbi Eliezer and Shmuel speaking like Rabbi Y'hoshuah?
On their understanding of Rabbi Eliezer there is no disagreement.
The disagreement is on their understanding of Rabbi Y'hoshuah
Shmuel agrees with Rabbi Y'hoshuah and Rav
He is not in agreement with Rabbi Y'hoshuah except how he sees the obligations from the wife to the husband, but not on the obligations from the husband to the wife.
And no property:
Said Rav Huna son of Chiyah to Rav Kahana
You have said to us in the name of Shmuel
There is no difference with the articles of Meeloog [between this case and a normal marriage], but with the articles of Tzon Barzel she is entitled to that property.

Mishna: Anyone can bring [their spouse] up to the Land of Israel, but not anyone cannot bring [their spouse] down. Anyone can bring [their spouse] up to the Jerusalem, but not anyone cannot bring [their spouse] down. [All this applies to] both men and women.





















He wishes to leave Israel, and she does not want to leave, we force him not to leave, and if not, he divorces her and pays her her Ketuba.
