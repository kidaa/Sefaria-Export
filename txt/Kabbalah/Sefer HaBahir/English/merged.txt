Sefer HaBahirRabbi Nechunia ben Hakana said: one verse states (Job 37:21), "And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies."  Another verse states (Psalms 18:12), "He made darkness His hiding-place." And (Psalms 97:2), "Clouds and darkness are round about Him." This is a difficulty. A third scripture reconciles them (Psalms 139:12):  "Even the darkness is not too dark for Thee, But the night shineth as the day; The darkness is even as the light."
Rabbi Berechiah said: it is written (Genesis 1:2), "Now the earth was unformed (tohu) and void (bohu)." What does "was" mean here? It means the tohu existed [already]. What is tohu? Something that confounds (m'taha) people. And what is bohu? The counterpoint of tohu. Again, what is bohu? A substance of real existence, written "it is inside it" (bo hu).
Why does the Torah begin with "ב"? To start with a blessing (bracha), as it is written (Deuteronomy 33:23), "Full with the blessing of the LORD, possess thou the sea and the south." The sea is none other than Torah, as it is written (Job 11:9), "And broader than the sea." What does "Full with the blessing" mean?
