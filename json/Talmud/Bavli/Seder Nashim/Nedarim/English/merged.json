What are the things that belong to that town? E.G., the public square, the bathhouse, the synagogue, the ark [in which the Torah scrolls were kept] and the scrolls[of Torah], and [the estate of] one who assigns his portion to the Nasi. Rabbi Yehudah said, \"It is the same whether he assigns it to the Nasi or to a common individual, but what is the difference? If he assigns it to the Nasi, he need not formally confer title, while in the case of a common individual it is necessary to confer title. But the Rabbis say, \"Formal grant of title is necessary in both cases. They mentioned the Nasi as this is usual. Rabbi Yehudah said, \"The Galileans need not assign [their portion] because their ancestors have already done so for them."
