And Hashem spoke to Moses, saying:
Speak with Aharon and with his sons, saying this is how you will bless the Children of Israel. Say to them:
May Hashem bless you and guard you.
May Hashem [reveal] (lit. "shine") his presence upon you and love you.

And they [the Priests] should place the blessing [that is] My name upon the Children of Israel, and I will bless them.

And Moses said to the children of Israel all that God commanded Moses.
And Moses spoke with the leaders of the tribes of the children of Israel saying, These are the words that God has commanded:
Any man who vows a vow before God, or oaths an oath to prohibit a prohibition on himself, he cannot void his word; anything that his mouth utters he shall do.
And any woman who vows a vow before God, or prohibits a prohibition in her father's house, as a young girl
And her father hears her vow and prohibition that she prohibited on herself, and her father remains silent, and all her vows are upheld, all her prohibitions she prohibited on herself are upheld.
