            "It is a positive obligation to build a house for God where offerings may be brought and to make pilgrimage to it three times a year as it says \"and they shall make Me a sanctuary.\" The tabernacle which Moses made in the desert has already been described in the Torah, but it was a temporary measure, as it says \"for you have not yet reached, etc.\"", 
            "Once [the Israelites] entered the Land, they set up the tabernacle at Gilgal [where it remained fourteen years while] they conquered and divided the land. From there it went to Shiloh, where they built a stone building without a ceiling and spread the sheets from the [original] tabernacle over it. It stayed in Shiloh for 369 years until Eli [the High Priest] died and it was destroyed and moved to Nob. When Samuel died, it moved to Gibeon, and from there it came to the Eternal House. The period of Nob and Gibeon [together] was 57 years.", 
            "Once the Temple was built in Jerusalem, all other places became ineligible for building Houses of God or to offer sacrifices there, and for all generations there is no Temple other than the one in Jerusalem and only on Mt. Moriah about which David said \"This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar for the offerings of Israel\" and it says \"This is My resting place forever.\"", 
            "The building which Solomon built has already been described in I Kings. Similarly, the Temple which will be built in the future which is mentioned in Ezekiel, is not described clearly or completely. The people of the Second commonwealth built their Temple like Solomon's with some of the features described explicitly in Ezekiel.", 
            "The following are the major requirements for the Temple: It must have a sanctuary and an inner sanctum. There must be a space in front of the sanctuary called the Hall (אולם) and the three together are called \"Heichal\" (היכל). Another wall must be built around the Heichal away from the building itself, like the curtains around the courtyard of the tabernacle in the desert. Everything enclosed by this wall representing the yard of the tabernacle is called the Court (עזרה) and the whole compound is called \"Temple\" (מקדש)", 
            "Vessels must be made for the Temple: An altar for burnt offerings and other sacrifices, and a ramp to access the altar; these are placed in front of the Hall slightly southward (of center). The basin and its base, which the priests use to wash their hands and feet for the service, are both placed between the altar and the Hall towards the south, on your left as you enter the sanctuary. A table, a (smaller) altar for incense, and a Menorah [are also necessary] and all three go in the sanctuary in front of the inner sanctum.", 
            "The Menorah belongs on the south side, on your left as you enter, and the table --which holds the show-bread -- on the right. Both of them are just outside the inner sanctum. The incense altar goes between them, but further out from the inner sanctum. The court is divided into sections for priests and Israelites, and rooms are built there for the various needs of the Temple. Each room is called an office (לשכה)", 
            "The Temple is to be built with large stones or bricks if large stones are not available. The stones are not carved on site, rather they are carved and dressed away from the Temple Mount and brought in afterwards, as it says \"Large, expensive stones for the foundation of the House, hewn stones\" and it [also] says \"the sound of the axe, nor any other metal tool was heard in the Temple while it was being built.\"", 
            "There is to be no visible wood structure in any part of the Temple compound, only stones or bricks and mortar. Even [temporary] wooden walkways in the Court are not allowed.", 
            "The floor of the Court is paved with expensive stones. If one of the stones was detached, even if it is still in place it is invalid [as part of the Temple] and a Priest cannot perform Temple services while standing on it until it is reattached.", 
            "The appropriate way to perform the Mitzvah is to [continuously] strengthen and expand the building as much as the community can afford as it says \"and to glorify the house of our God.\" It is also a mitzvah to renovate, and beautify the building. If [the community] can plate the whole thing in gold and to make [the architecture] famous, that too is a mitzvah.", 
            "The Temple is not to be built at night as it says \"and on the <i>day</i> the Tabernacle was erected,\" i.e. we erect it during the day but not at night. We may work on the construction from dawn until the stars come out, and everyone is obligated to build helping physically and financially both men and women just like the sanctuary in the desert. However, we do not close the schools in order [for the children] to build the Temple nor does building the Temple override Shabbat or the festivals.", 
            "The altar is made out of stones only. When the Torah says \"build Me an altar of earth\" it means that the altar should be part of the earth and not built over domes or arches. When it says \"and <i>if</i> you make Me a stone altar\" the oral tradition teaches that it is not permission but an obligation.", 
            "Any stone that was chipped enough to catch the fingernail [to the same exacting standards] as with a shechita knife, in unfit for the ramp and for the altar as it says \"With whole stones build the altar of God.\" Where did they get the stones? From virgin ground. They would dig down to where it was obvious that this soil is not for cultivating or building and take out whole stones, or they would take rocks from the Mediterranean Sea and build with those. Similarly, the stones of the Temple and the Courtyards were also whole. ", 
            "Stones of the Sanctuary or the courtyard which were chipped or scraped cannot be repaired, rather they must be hid away. Any stone which was touched by iron may not be used for the Altar or the ramp because it says \"for you have lifted your sword against it and desecrated it.\" One who built the ramp or the altar with stones touched by iron is flogged because it says (as a prohibition) \"do not build them of hewn stones\" but if one built with a chipped stone he has (only) transgressed a positive commandment.", 
            "A stone which was chipped or touched by iron after it was built into the altar or the ramp is invalid, but the rest [remain] valid. The alter was whitewashed twice a year at Passover and Sukkot and when they whitewashed it they used a cloth rather than a trowel to prevent iron from touching the stones.", 
            "It is forbidden to make steps up to the altar as it says \"thou shalt not go up on steps to My altar\" rather we build a sort of mound at the southern end of the altar which gets shorter and shorter until it reaches the ground and this is called a 'ramp.' One who ascends the altar on stairs is flogged, as is one who removes a stone from the altar, or from the entire Temple building or from the [area of courtyard] between the Temple and the altar as a destructive measure as it says \"thou shalt break up their altars etc.\" and it says \"thou shalt not do so to the LORD thy God.\"", 
            "The Menorah, its vessels, the Table, its vessels, the Incense-Altar, and all  vessels of the Divine Service may only be made out of metal; they are invalid if made out of wood, bone, stone or glass.", 
            "If the Community is poor they may even make [the vessels] out of lead. If they are rich, they [should] make them out of gold, even the pitchforks, skewers, and shovels of the Sacrificial Altar [which tend to get dirty]. [The community] should even plate the gates of the courtyard with gold if they can afford it.", 
            "The vessels must be originally made with the intent [to use them] for the Divine Service. If they were already made for mundane purposes they may not be used for sacred ones. Things that were made for sacred purposes but were not yet used may be used for mundane purposes but once they were used for a sacred purpose they become forbidden for the mundane. Stones and boards which were originally cut for a synagogue may not be built with on the Temple Mount."

            "The altar is placed extremely precisely and may never ever be placed anywhere else as it says \"This is the Altar for the offerings of Israel.\" And it was in the temple that Isaac was bound as it says \"and go to the land of Moriah\" and it says \"Solomon built the temple on Mt. Moriah.\"", 
            "And it is a tradition accepted by all, that the place where David and Solomon built the altar at the threshing floor of Arauna was the place that Abraham built the altar and bound Isaac upon it, and that was the place that Noah built upon when he left the ark, and that was the altar upon which Kain and Abel sacrificed, and upon which Adam the First sacrificed when he was created. And from there was born the saying of the sages that \"Man was created from the place of his atonement.\"", 
            "The measurements of the Altar are very exact and its shape is known [by tradition] from man to man. The altar that those who ascended from the [Babylonian] exile built was made like the one which will be built in the future. It is forbidden to add or subtract from its dimensions.", 
            "Of the three prophets who ascended with them from the exile, one testified as to the Altar's location, one to its dimensions, and one to the Law that the could bring offerings on the altar even though the there was no Temple [yet].", 
            "The Altar that Moses made, that Solomon made, that the returnees of the [First] Exile made, and that will be made in the future are all 10 cubits high, and that which is stated in the Torah: \"and three cubits its height, that is the place of the pyre alone (above the ledge of the Altar). And the dimensions of the Altar that the returnees of the Exile made and the one that will be built in the future are 32 cubits by 32 cubits.", 
            "The ten cubits of the height of the Altar, some of them are of a 5-handbreadth cubit and some are of a 6-handbreadth cubit, and the rest of the cubits of the building are of 6 handbreadths. The height of the entire Altar is 58 handbreadths. ", 
            "These are its dimensions and its shape: [Starting from the 32x32 cubit square at ground level] it goes up five hand-breadths and in five hand-breadths, [making] the base. Now it is 30 cubits and two hand-breadths. It goes up thirty hand-breadths and in five hand-breadths, making the ledge. [From there,] it went up another eighteen hand-breadths and this was the place of the pyre. Its width [on each side at the top] works out to [a square of] 28 cubits and four hand-breadths by 28 cubits and four hand-breadths. [From the top], it went up [another] eighteen hand-breadths built as a hollow structure at each corner. The place for the \"horns\" was one cubit by one cubit, and the path for the priests was one cubit by one cubit, so the [dimensions of the] place of the pyre works out to 24 cubits and four handbreadths by 24 cubits and four hand-breadths.", 
            "The height of each corner piece is five hand-breadths and [each was] one cubit square. The four corner pieces were hollow inside and the place of the Pyre was 18 hand-breadths high. [Thus we] find that half the height of the altar was 29 hand-breadths from the ledge down.", 
            "A red stripe girdled the Altar in the middle (about six hand-breadths below the ledge) to separate between the blood of the Higher [half] and the blood of the Lower [half]. And its height from the ground comes to nine cubits less one hand-breadth. ", 
            "The base of the Altar did not surround it on all four sides, rather it went along the entire north and west sides, one cubit on the south and one cubit on the east, and the southeast corner had no base.", 
            "The southwest corner had two holes like thin pipes called \"shittin\" through which the blood drained into the [underground stream] at that corner and went out to the Kidron.", 
            "And below that corner there was a trapdoor in the floor by which they could go down to the \"shittin\" and clean them.", 
            "A ramp was built at the south of the altar 32 cubits long by sixteen wide and took up 30 cubits of floor from the side of the altar, and spread out a cubit over the base and a cubit over the ledge, and a little air space was between the ramp and the altar to allow the limbs [of the sacrifices] to be thrown, and the ramp was nine cubits high less one sixth to parallel the pyre.", 
            "Two small ramps branched out from the [large] ramp to the base and the ledge and they were separated from the altar itself by a hair and there was a niche in the west side of the ramp where invalidated bird offerings were left until they decayed and were brought out to the place of burning.", 
            "And two tables were at the west of the ramp, one of marble on which they put the limbs [of the offerings] and one was of silver on which they put the vessels.", 
            "The altar is built completely solid like  a pillar without any hollow bits at all. They bring whole stones, large and small, mortar, tar and plaster and they mix it and dump it all into a big form. And they make a hollow wooden or stone structure in the southeast corner the size of the base and at each corner [on top] so that the southeast corner won't have a base and the corner pieces will stay hollow.", 
            "The four corner-pieces of the altar, its base, and its squareness are all essential and any altar that does not have corner-pieces, a base, a ramp, and squareness is invalid for they are all essential, however its length, width, and height are not essential as long as it is not less than one cubit [wide] by once cubit [long] by three cubits [high] like the  pyre-space of the Altar in the desert.", 
            "An altar that [has a piece] broken off of its structure is valid as long as the missing piece is less than a hand-breadth and so long as what is left does not contain a chipped stone."

You have no burden on your shoulders, now serve your God etc.'\" and Aharon's staff, the jar of Manna, and the anointing oil were all hidden with it; none of these returned in the second Temple, and even the Urim V'tumim of the second temple did not answer with the Divine Spirit and they did not consult it as it says \"until a priest shall arise for the Urim V'tumim\" and they only made it to complete the 8 vestments of the High Priest so he would not lack the [required] clothing.",
