Rashbam on Genesis

Chapter 1



Verse 1

Enlightened ones shall understand that all the words of our Masters and their interpretations are true and well-founded. This is what is stated in [the Talmudic tractate] <i>Shabbat</i>: “I was eighteen years old and I didn’t know that Scripture does not depart from its simple meaning…” The essential part of the laws and the interpretations stem from [otherwise] extraneous [phrasings] of Scripture or from a change of language, where the simple meaning of Scripture is written in a manner that enables learning from it the essential part of the interpretation, such as “These are the generations of the heavens and the earth in their bing created <i>b’hibar’am</i> – where the Sages interpreted, “through Avraham” from the extra wording, for it did not need to write <i>b’hibar’am</i>. Now, I will explain the explanations of the early authorities (<i>Rishonim</i>) regarding this verse, making it known to people why I have not seen fit to explain as they did. There are those who explain “At first, G-d created the heavens and the earth”. But it is impossible to say this, for behold, the waters came first, as it is written, “And the spirit of G-d hovered over the waters”. And further, what is written here is not “in the beginning”, but rather, “in the beginning of”, which is attached to what follows, such as “And the beginning of his kingdom was Bavel”. Now the one who explains like, “the beginning of G-d’s speaking with Hoshea”, that is, “At the beginning of G-d’s creating the heavens”, that is, “before He created heaven and earth, the earth was void and without form and darkness was over the deep and the spirit of G-d hovered over the waters” so that it turns out that the waters were created first, this is also vanity, for then it would not be appropriate to write, “ and the earth was void and without form”, for since it hadn’t yet been created, it would be inappropriate to call it “earth” before the creation of the waters, since the waters came first. Rather, this is its essential simple meaning: it is the way of Scripture to anticipate and explain something which is not strictly necessary for the sake of something mentioned further on in another place. As it is written, “Shem, Ham and Yefet”, and it is written, “Ham is Kena’an’s father” – for since it is written further on, “cursed is Kena’an”, yet it didn’t explain first who Kena’an is, we wouldn’t know why Noach cursed him. Or: “And he laid with Bilhah, his father’s concubine and Yisrael heard” – why is it written here “and Yisrael heard”? Behold, it isn’t written here that Ya’akov spoke with Re’uven at all? Rather, since at the time of his passing, he said “Unstable as water, you will not have excellence; because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it--he went up to my couch”, therefore, it wrote first the passage “And Yisrael heard”, so that you should not be surprised when you see that he reproves him regarding this at the end of his days. And similarly, in several places. Also the entire passage of the work of the six days Moshe our master wrote first to explain what Hashem said at the time of the giving of the Torah, “Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it…for, six days did Hashem make the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in it, and He rested on the seventh day”. This is why it is written “and it was evening, and it was morning, the sixth day” – that same sixth day which is the conclusion of the six days spoken of at the giving of the Torah.  This is why Moshe said this to the Jewish people, to inform them that the word of the Holy One (praised be He!) is true. Are you of the opinion that this world, all its days, has been [completely] built-up the way you see it now, filled with everything good? It was not like this, rather, "In the beginning G-d created…" - that is to say, at the beginning of the creating of heaven and earth - at the time that the supernal heaven and earth were already created - whether that [lasted] a long time or a short time - at that time, the earth was [void and without form].

Verse 2

"Then the earth was" – that [earth which] was built already 
"was void and empty" – there was nothing in it, as it is written in Jeremiah, “I saw the earth and, behold, it was void and empty, and [I looked] to the heavens, and there was no light; I saw and there was no man, nor bird of the heavens, nor beast wandering, going forth” – this is <i>tohu vavohu</i>, destruction, without dwellers.
 “and darkness upon the waters” – this is (Jeremiah) “and toward the heavens and there was no light”
“and wind/spirit…blowing upon the waters” – the wind was necessary for what is written further on, “and G-d said, ‘let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one spot”, for it was by the wind that the waters were gathered” - just as the Red Sea was split so that the dry land was visible, by means of “and G-d led the sea with a powerful East wind all that day, turning the sea into dry land, and the waters were split”.

Verse 3

“And G-d said, ‘Let there be light’” – to fix that which was mentioned above – “and darkness upon the face of the deep”.

Verse 4

“And G-d saw the light” – He looked at its appearance [and saw] that it was beautiful. And similarly, “And she saw him, that he was good” – she looked at Moshe born at six months, like Samuel – at the turn of the year – and she saw that he was good and beautiful – his indications (<i> simanav</i>, fingernails and hair were grown – so she hid him three months, that is, until the end of nine months, for behold, she saw him and knew that he was good and beautiful regarding his indications, he was not miscarried.
“And G-d separated between the light and the dark” – such that 12 hours did the day last, and then 12 hours night. Light first, and afterwards, darkness. For, behold, the beginning of the creation of the worlds was with the statement, “Let there be light”. And any darkness that preceded that, as it is written, “and darkness on the face of the deep” – this was not night.

Verse 5

“And G-d called the light day” – ask yourself: according to the straightforward meaning, why did G-d need to call the light "day" at the moment of its creation? Rather, this is what Moshe, our master, wrote: every place in the words of the Omnipresent where we see “day” and "night", such as “day and night shall not cease” (Genesis 8:22)– that is [referring to] the light and darkness created on the first day – Hashem calls them in all places “day” and “night”.  And likewise for every “And G-d called” written in this passage. And likewise, “And Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun: Yehoshua” (Numbers 13:15) [referring to] what was stated earlier “for the tribe of Ephraim – Hoshea bin Nun” (Numbers 13:8) – he’s the same one whom Moshe called “Yehoshua bin Nun”, whom he appointed previously as servant in his house. For, it is the manner of kings when appointing people over their house to give them new names, as it is stated, “And Par’oh called Yosef’s name <i>Tzafnat Pa’aneach</i>” (Genesis 45:45), [or] “and he called Daniel <i>Belshatzar</i> (Daniel 1:7).
"And the darkness He called night" - Light is always first, and afterwards, darkness.
“And it was evening, and it was morning” – It is not written here, “And it was night, and it was day”, but rather, “and it was evening, and it was morning” – the first day became evening and the sun set, and it became morning, the morning following the night, for the dawn broke” – behold, one day was completed from the six that Hashem spoke of in the Ten Commandments, and afterwards began the second day: “G-d said, ‘let there be a firmament’”. The text does not come to state that the evening and the morning are part of a single day, for it only needs to explain how there were six days – that the morning broke and the night was finished: behold, one days was completed and another day began.

Verse 6

“And G-d said, ‘Let there be a firmament’” – after the first days was completed, the next morning, G-d said…
“Firmament” (<i>rakia</i>) – in the passive voice, like <i>ashir</i> (“rich”), meaning “made rich”, or <i>chasid</i> (“pious”), meaning “made pious”. For, from the earth up until the supernal heavens there was water, as it is written, “(the spirit of G-d) hovering upon the face of the waters”, and now the Holy One (praised be He!) divided them at the middle and made a hammered-out plate extending from east to west and from north to south to make a distinction between the supernal waters. Now since he didn’t complete the work of the waters until the third day, when dry land appeared, it does not state “it was good” on the second day, but on the third day it is stated twice, “it was good” – once for the work of the waters and once for the emergence of the trees and grasses.
“between water and water” – so that half would be above and half would be below.


Verse 7



Verse 8

“And G-d called the firmament ‘heaven’” – as I explained above, that is, it is called <i>shamayim</i> everywhere in the Torah, and the supernal waters were included in the heavens of the heavens and all their host, [as in] “indeed, to Hashem are the heavens, the heavens of the heavens, etc.”
“And it was evening, and it was morning, a second day” – the day inclined toward evening, after which was the morning after the second day, behold, the second of the six days spoken of by the Holy One (praised be He!) in the Ten Commandments, and now the third day began that morning.


Verse 9

“And G-d said, ‘Let gather’” – as I explained above, by means of the wind, for that is why it is said, “A wind/spirit of G-d hovering..”, as with the splitting of the Red Sea. For just as He divided the supernal waters, separating them from the lower waters by means of the firmament, likewise did He gather the lower waters by means of the wind.
“’and the dry land shall be seen’” – that is to say, the land created together with the supernal waters before light was created, as I explained above, whether a longer time before or a brief time.

Verse 10

“(and He called) the dry land <i>eretz</i> (“earth”) – as I explained above – the dry land is what is called “earth” throughout the Torah.

Verse 11

“<i>deshe</i>” – all types of grasses together are called “<i>deshe</i>”, and each kind by itself is called “<i>’eisev</i>”
“making fruit for its kind” – according to the straightforward sense, “<i>l’mino</i>” was said regarding the grasses. For “<i>l’mino</i>” stated regarding trees making fruit is referring also to the <i>eisev</i> seeding its seed.
“making fruit by its kind” – an apple tree makes apples and not dates.
“whose seed is in it” – inside the apple there are seeds from which can be planted a tree for all kinds of fruit.”


Verse 12



Verse 13



Verse 14

“let there be luminaries” – it is the way of Scripture to use a singular [verb form] in place of plural, like “And there were (singular form) men who were impure”. Its meaning is: There was an event – and what was it? Luminaries.
“in the firmament of the heaven” – which was beaten out and spread under the supernal heavens.
“in the firmament” – since it is attached to the word following it, that is to say, the firmament <b>of<</b> the heavens, therefore it is vocalized with a <i>chataf</i>. Similarly with [the word] <i>katzir</i> (“harvest”) – when it is attached, it will say, “until the end of the barley harvest (<i>k’tzir</i> and the wheat harvest (<i>k’tzir</i>. We have already said above: “To differentiate between day and night” – we have already said above “and G-d divided between the light and the darkness”, but still, the actual end of night and beginning of day is not known except by sunrise, and similarly, the end of day and the beginning of night is not known except by sunset and [when] the starts come out – to distinguish between the beginning of the day and the beginning of the night.
“And they will be for signs and for appointed times” – as it is written regarding Hezekiah, “this will be for you a sign from Hashem, etc….the shadow will go ten steps etc…” – behold, the sun was for him a sign… “I’ve set wonders in the heavens and upon the land, blood and fire, etc…” and it is written, “do not fear the signs of heaven”.
“And for appointed times” – from the path of the moon, which is renewed every 29 ½ days, the appointed days of the year and the dates for legal documents are known, as it is written, “He made the moon for appointed times”
“and for days” – for behold, from one appearance of starts until the next is one day.
“and years” – four seasons of the year constituted a complete year.

Verse 15

“and they shall be for luminaries” – they will serve to illuminate the world.

Verse 16

“the small” – of the two great luminaries

Verse 17



Verse 18

“And to distinguish between light and dark” – between the beginning of light and the beginning of dark. Sunrise is the beginning of light; the appearance of stars is the beginning of dark.

Verse 19



Verse 20

“will fly upon the earth” – even though the creation of fowls was from the water, their growth and life will be upon the earth.


Verse 21

“The great crocodiles” – even though the Holy One said, “let them swarm”, referring to the fishes which are not so large, nevertheless, He also created the crocodiles, mentioned elsewhere, with them – “Leviathan – the straight serpent, and Leviathan, the crooked serpent”, spoken of in the prophets, as well as in Job: “Shall you drawn Leviathan on your hook?”

Verse 22

“G-d  blessed them “ – you find that He blessed all forms of life – fishes and birds, man and beasts domestic and wild.
“Fill the waters” – [<i>mil’u</i> is] a command form of the simple (non-intensive) pattern, similar to “Say <i>imru</i> to G-d”, “Chase <i>ridfu</i> quickly”, but <i>mal’u</i> is the command form for the intensified pattern, such as “Speak <i>dabb’ru</i> to the entire assembly of the children of Israel”, “Strengthen <i>chazz’ku</i> weak hands.
“Will multiply” – [&lt;<i>yirev</i> is]similar to <i>yirbeh</i>, and like [<i>yifen</i> is] similar to <i>yifneh</i>. Similarly all simple verbs ending with <i>hey</i>, such as <i>panah, kanah, banah, machah</i>, it will say <i>vayifen, vayiken, vayiven, vayimach</i> 

Verse 23



Verse 24

“And the creatures of the earth” – [<i>chayto</i> similar to “a fountain (<i>ma’yano</i>) of water”, “the son of  (<i>b’no</i>) Be’or”, with an extra <i>vav</i>
“And it was so” – that is to say: thus it was forever


Verse 25



Verse 26

“and He said” – to His angels
“Let us make man” – like we find with Michayahu ben Yimla in Kings, and in Yeshayahu, “Who shall I send, who will go for <u>us</u>”, and also in Job.
“after our likeness” – regarding our minds. Behold, when a person sins [lit. – “is ruined”], it is written, “he is compared, he is likened to a beast”
“and they shall rule” – <i>urdu</i>, from <i>radah</i> like <i>vaya’asu</i> (“they shall do”) is from <i>asah</i>; <i>bakhah</i> - <i>vayivkhu</i>,; <i>shavah</i>, - <i>vayishbu</i>

Verse 27

“in his image” – the image of man – that was made in the image of <i>elohim</i> - angels. Now don’t be surprised that the creation of angels was not made explicit, for Moshe wrote here neither angels, nor Gehenna, nor the Work of the Chariot, but rather those things we see in the world and are mentioned in the Ten Commandments, for that’s the reason for [recounting] all of the Work of the six days, as I explained above.
“male and female He created them” – as it makes explicit later on: “and He took one of his sides” – general, followed by specific (<i>klal ufrat</i>). And thus did I find in the 32 Rules of Interpretation [for narrative passages] of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosi the Galilean, who learned the rule of <i>klal ufrat</i> from this verse.


Verse 28

“and subdue it” – non-intensified, like “and the land was subdued before them”. Now since it is a command form in a non-intensified pattern, therefore [the word is] non-intensified, but <i>kibshuha</i> [the same word with an intensifying mark in the middle letter] is a past-tense form, like “collect (<i>kibb’tzu</i>) [in a] bowl”.

Verse 29

“behold, I have given to you” – I am giving to you now, <i>doinas</i> [in Old French]. And similarly, “I have raised my hand” – I am raising; “I have given the money for the field” - I am giving.

Verse 30

“for all the beasts of the earth, etc.” – but flesh was not permitted to the first man, until Noach came and [G-d] said to him, “like the vegetables and grasses, I have given to you everything”.

Verse 31

“And it was evening, and it was morning” – then was the sixth day completed, as well as the [entire] beginning.
“and G-d saw everything that He had made and behold, it was very good” – He looked carefully at all of His work and all of His actions which He had done [to see] if there was anything in them which needed perfecting, and behold, all were beautiful and perfected.

Verse 1

1 He was advanced in years.  This is to say, the time had come to marry off his son during his lifetime.
2. And God blessed Abraham [with everything] - this is to inform/explain to us about what is said in [the text in] front of us, that Abraham did not send his servant to take a wife [for Isaac] on account of lack of women in the Land of Canaan or because no one wanted to mate with him, because Abraham had been blessed with everything and the entire world desired to mate with Isaac, but because he only wanted a spouse for Isaac from his family.  This is why Abraham's servant said: "And Adonai blessed my master very much and he has become wealthy."  And it is for this reason that the text needed to explain first that God had blessed Abraham "with everything," as in a similar instance: "And Ham was the father of Canaan" (Genesis 9:18).

Those who love pure reason should always remember that the sages have said a Biblical passage must not be deprived of its plain meaning. Because the main point of Torah comes to teach us and tell us in hints found in the plain meaning of the text, the hagadot, and halachot and laws derived through lengthy words and the 32 and 13 laws by which we derive law from the text of the Torah. The Rishonim, because of their piety busied themselves with the drashot as their focus, and they did not regularly delve into the plain meaning of the text, and because the Chachamim said not to spend too much time with logic and expressed the significance not of learning Torah but of learning Talmud as having no greater measure, they did not regularly engage in establishing the plain meaning of the text. Even Rashi the father of my mother set his heart to explain the plain meaning of the text, even my grandfather Shlomo was an adherent of this school; and I had an argument with him on that account, in which he admitted that he would make new commentaries according to the plain meanings that arise each day.

Verse 3

כי תועבה, something so abhorrent to the Egyptians that they would spit out when observing such a “barbaric” way of eating meat. We know from other sources also that the Egyptians were of a very haughty disposition as mentioned for instance by Isaiah 30,7 קראתי לזאת רהב הם שבת, “truly, I call this, ‘they are a threat that has ceased.’” [the prophet calls Egypt a ‘paper tiger’ in his time. Ed.] The Egyptians’ attitude to people whose vocation was to tend flocks was one of utter disdain, as we know from 46,34. They had contempt for sheep and goats, hence their contempt transferred itself to the people raising such animals. This attitude to sheep and goats is mirrored when Moses asks Pharaoh how he could expect the Israelites to slaughter such animals while in Egypt without running the risk of the local populace stoning them to death for doing this. (Exodus 8,22) Stoning someone to express one’s disgust with his conduct is nothing new; we encounter it in Samuel II 16,5-6 when Shimi ben Geyrah, not only cursed (king) David publicly, but also threw stones at him.
