Verse 6

"Upon your walls, oh Jerusalem" Our rabbis explained this according to its implied meaning - angels who recall her destruction before Gd in order that He rebuild her. What did they say? "You will rise, You will have mercy on Zion..." (Tehillim 102:14) "For the Lord has chosen Zion..." (Tehillim 132:13) as it says in tractate Menachot. Yonatan translates 'your walls' as the forefathers who guard us like a wall.
