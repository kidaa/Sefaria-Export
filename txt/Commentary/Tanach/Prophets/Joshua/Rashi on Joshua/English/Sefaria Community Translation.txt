Rashi on Joshua

Chapter 1



Verse 1

And it was after the death of Moshe: It links with the Torah that has just finished with the passing away of Moshe and there is the coupling.

Verse 2

Moshe, my servant, died: And our Rabbis explain (תמורה טז א) upon three thousand halachot which came about during the days of mourning for Moshe, Yehoshua came and asked and Hakadosh Baruch Hu said to him, Moshe my servant has died and the Torah in his name I called out and he said to him, go and lead them into war

Verse 3

Every place which your legs shall lead you:

Verse 4

From the desert of Lebanon: This is the desert of Kadesh, the desert of Tzin which to the side of Edom and was the southwestern border and the way there led to the Land. As it is said (Bamidbar 20:16) "We are in Kadesh" from which we know in the south-west. As it is said (Ibid. 34:3) "Your southern border will be in the desert of Tzin by the side of Edom
...Until the great river, the Euphrates: This is the limit from south to North
All of the Hittite land: With the same principle
And until the great sea towards the setting sun: From the west to the east.

Verse 5



Verse 6

Be strong and courageous: In the way of the land, therefore it says later: because you will allot inheritances. 

Verse 7

Only be strong and very courageous: In Torah, as it is said: To guard and to carry out the whole Torah
Have success: Succeed

Verse 8

This book of the Torah: The Torah which was in front of them. 
And you shall meditate on it: And you shall study it, [for] all meditation in the torah is in the heart, like it is said, "And let the meditation of my heart be before you (Psalms 19:15)", [and also] "May your heart meditate [on] fear (Isaiah 33:18)."

Verse 9

As I commanded you, be strong and courageous: In war, as it is said: Don't be scared or dismayed. And he had been asked to do so previously, in the days of Moshe (Devarim 31:23) "And he compelled Yehoshua Bin Nun etc"

Verse 10

And Joshua commanded: On the day that the period of crying in mourning for Moses ceased.

Verse 11

Prepare for yourself equipment- He told them to fix all the things that were needed on the path, and their vessels for warfare. For if you say [that 'equipment'] is referring to food and drink, [you are wrong because] they were given enough [food] by the manna in their vessels until the 15th of Nisan. As it says, "(Joshua 5:12) And the manna ceased the next day." (This according to Rabbi [Judah the Prince]).

Verse 15

Use of the definite article in the phrase, "She lowered them by the rope through the window" is a reference to the very same rope and window that her paramours would use to ascend to her chambers. She thus proclaimed, "Master of the Universe! By these very things I transgressed, let me now achieve absolution by them."
