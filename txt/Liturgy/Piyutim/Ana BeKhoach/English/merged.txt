Ana BeKhoach

Song 1

Please, with the strength of the greatness of your right hand, free the pressed.
Accept the pleasantness of your people; uphold us, purifty us, o awesome one!
Please, mighty one, guard the seekers of your unity like the apple of an eye.
Bless them, purify them; may the mrcy of your justice always accompany them.
Holy stronghold, guide your flock with all of your goodness.
Unique one
