The House of Avtinas. There they would make the incense.

Mishna 6

If he was clever he would explain. The issue of halacha all night of Yom Kippur, so that he wouldn't fall asleep. And if he wasn't so clever, and wasn't able to understand and explain an issue of halacha, then they would explain it to him.
From Job and Ezra. These are things which depress the heart and make it hard to sleep.
