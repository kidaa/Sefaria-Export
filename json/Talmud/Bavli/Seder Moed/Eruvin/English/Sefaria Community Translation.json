But could not the man, if he so wished, bring [the eruv] by way of the upper part of the tree? -- [This is a case] where many people adjust their burdens on it, and [this ruling is] in agreement with that of Ulla who laid down: If a column, nine handbreadths high, was situated in a public domain and many people were adjusting their burdens on it, any man who throws an object that comes to rest upon It is guilty.",

[If the eruv was deposited] within three [handbreadths from the ground] it is permitted to move it. If he put it in a basket and hung it upon the tree his ‘eruv is effective even if it was above [a height] of ten handbreadths; Rabbi. But the Sages ruled: Wherever it is forbidden to move it the ‘eruv is ineffective. Now to what [does the statement,] ‘But the cages ruled’ refer? If it be suggested: To the final clause, [the difficulty would arise:] Does this imply that the Rabbis hold the opinion that [the use of the] sides [is also] forbidden? Consequently [it must refer] to the first clause. But then, what [size of] tree is done to imagine? If [it is one] which is less than four [handbreadths in width,] then, surely, it is a spot of exemption; and if it was four [handbreadths wide,] what is [the use, it may be asked,] that the ‘eruv was put in a basket? — Ravina replied: The first clause [is a case] where [the tree] had [a width] of four [handbreadths, while] the final clause [deals with one] whose width was less than four [handbreadths] but the basket supplemented it to four"

Aaron then distanced himself and sat to Moses' left. His sons then entered and Moses taught them their portion. They then distanced themselves and Elazar sat to the right of Moses and Itamar to the left of Aaron. Rabbi Yehuda said, Aaron was always on the right of Moses. Returning, the elders entered and Moses taught them their portion. The elders distanced themselves and the entire nation entered and Moses taught them their portion. The result was that Aaron heard the teaching four times, his sons, three times, the elders, twice, and the entire nation, once. Moses then distanced himself and Aaron repeated his portion. His sons then repeated their portion and left. The elders then repeated their portion and left. In this way, everyone heard everything four times. Based on this method, Rabbi Eliezer said, everyone is obligated to repeat his teachings to his disciples four times. This is obvious, by force of argument: If Aaron learned Torah from Moses and Moses directly from God, and then ordinary people from each other certainly!"
